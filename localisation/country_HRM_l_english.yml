If Daybreaker wins here, there will be nothing to stop her from burning this world to its foundations and building an empire of oppression on the ashes. An empire just as cruel and eternal as she is. Front lines may collapse and cities may be put to the flame, but each one of us knows the consequences of defeat. For the sake of freedom itself, we will never yield!"
