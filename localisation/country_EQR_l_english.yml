 solrokenhardesc:0 "Rokenhar had always been a competent civil servant, perfectly content with the repetitive, paper-pushing routine of his daily duties. He had risen to the position of Mayor of Las Pegasus, a position that, until recently, required very few actual skills beyond being able to make the occasional public speech. The enormous, entrenched, immovable inertia of the ancient Equestrian bureaucracy took care of practically all of the actual work. His job may not have been stimulating, but it was as peaceful as the tired old stallion could hope for.\n\nUnfortunately for Rokenhar, that peace was not to last. The rise of Daybreaker came as a shock to them all. In the span of a single day the system he served had vanished, replaced by tyranny and militarism. Opposition to these changes sprang up almost as quickly, with the Las Pegasus harmonists all but forcing Rokenhar into the position of leading the revolution against Daybreaker.\n\nWith the might of the Solar Empire now turned against him, Rokenhar faces the most difficult challenge of his career. Will harmony prevail, or will the Republic of Equestria be the first nation to lie broken at Daybreaker’s hooves?"

In her place Empress Daybreaker rises like the sun, ready to plunge Equestria into an era of tyranny and slaughter.

It is heavily divided along ideological lines, with thestrals cultists on one side and harmonists only supporting us out of a lack of better options on the other. If our army is to be effective at winning us liberty, it must function as a cohesive entity under the leadership of one pony."
 lunarep.12.t:0 "Choosing Our Commander"
 lunarep.12.d:0 "As the civil war consumes Equestria, we can no longer afford to have our army divided by petty ideological differences. If we remain a rag-tag group of militias fighting with guerilla tactics, Daybreaker will simply pick us off one by one. To create one united army, we shall call a conclave of our most experienced commanders and appoint a Commander-In-Chief who will be in charge of determining our nation's doctrine and craft our warfare style to their will. Four candidates have been presented before us, each representing powerful factions within our rebellion.\n\nFirst is Marshal Speck. Speck has received the most conventional military training out of the four candidates and favors warfare similar to the fledgling Equestrian army, with planning and logistics being essential for its conduct. He is favoured by the thestral traditionalists.\n\n[nlr_warmaster_second_desc]\n\nThird is General Caltrop Deekay. Much like Selenite, Deekay's doctrine is rooted in the reality of modern war, but approaches it from a different direction. Deekay says that the weapon that shall win the wars of the second millennium is the tank. She cites her own experiences fighting in the December Revolution and numerous conflicts fought across Griffonia as proof that mobile warfare is the definitive means to secure a quick and bloodless victory over a numerically superior enemy. Deekay is favoured by the harmonist old guard.\n\nLast comes Midnight Oil. He bluntly declares that the Empire has two resources that it can use to emerge victoriously: It's large supply of ponypower, and its near unrivalled industrial capacity. He has combined this with his own theories about the nature of warfare regarding large front operations. Some call his doctrines barbaric. He calls them effective. Midnight Oil is favoured by the Nightmare cultists."
 nlr_warmaster_second_desc_selenite:0 "Second is Selenite. An extremely young officer, but fanatically loyal, Selenite has stated that the lives of ponykind are too valuable for the war tactics of old to be used. She suggests to take full advantage of the new wonders of modern weaponry and refine it into a storm of iron and gunpowder, arguing that her strategies save lives and are more effective in the modern era. Her candidacy is backed by the harmonist military."
 nlr_warmaster_second_desc_rose:0 "Second is Galaxy Rose. An young and inexperienced general, but one that has proven herself worthy of her legion's trust, Rose has stated that the lives of ponykind are too valuable for the war tactics of old to be used.

The beseiged [NLR.GetName] is pleading for the rest of the world to send them soldiers and equipment. Our cabinet has advised we consider [NLR.GetLeader]'s request closely. While we may not have always seen eye-to-eye with the Equestrians, there is no doubt that Daybreaker's victory in this civil war would be a threat to us all. Her expansionist rhetoric has already alarmed many of our generals. This may be our only chance to eliminate her before she can grow strong enough to attack us.\n\nOthers within our goverment have suggested we ignore [NLR.GetLeader]'s request. We have our own problems to deal with and cannot spare the soldiers or equipment to support foreign rebels. Surely [NLR.GetLeader] can win her war without our help?"

Daybreaker was quick to do away with any semblance of decency in this civil war, instructing her army of fanatics to take no mercy upon us. Now there is pressure on [NLR.GetLeader] to do the same. Despite her best efforts to stay true to the principles of harmony and only use violence on combatants who refuse to surrender, she finds herself surrounded by advisors and generals clambering for the restrictions placed upon them to be lifted. These advisors, most of them originating from the thestral clans, argue that the lives of those that have thrown their lot in with Daybreaker are a small price to pay for victory.\n\nOpposing them are the harmonist hardliners. They argue that if [NLR.GetLeader] removes these restrictions, she will be no better than Daybreaker.
