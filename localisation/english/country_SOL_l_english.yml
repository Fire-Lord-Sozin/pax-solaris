 EAW_WS_SOL:0 "[Root.GetNameDef] - The Ascendant Superpower"
 EAW_WS_SOL_desc:0 "Thousands of years ago, before the southward migration, the three tribes of ponies - unicorns, pegasi and earth ponies - weren't united like in the modern day, and instead argued and fought with one another. Things got worse as the climate turned colder and colder. The ponies left their homeland and many migrated south, to a new virgin land. Each pony tribe thought they were superior in a way and claimed the land for themselves, but only together could they prevail in the end. Equestrian folklore says that the three leaders of the tribes were locked away in a cave in the middle of a blizzard, and that the only reason they survived was cooperation and friendship. Henceforth, the tribes were united under a common banner and flag: §GEquestria§! was born.\n\nSoon after its foundation, §YPrincess Celestia§! and her younger sister §CPrincess Luna§! were called to lead the ponies of §GEquestria§!. The two Princesses are immortal Alicorns, sharing the abilities of each of the three races, and are powerful enough to raise and lower the Sun and Moon. They were the guardians of §GEquestria§! for a long time and protected it through §Ythe Elements of Harmony§!, defeating great, dangerous enemies such as §RDiscord, the Spirit of Chaos§! and §RKing Sombra§! of the Crystal Empire. §CPrincess Luna§! eventually fell prey to jealousy, however, as ponies did not appreciate the Night she brought, loving instead the Day of her older sister. She transformed into the wicked §RNightmare Moon§!, eclipsed the Sun with her Moon and attacked §YCelestia§!. In desperation, Celestia had no choice but to banish her sister to the Moon for a §Ythousand years§!. A new age began, where §GEquestria§! had a single ruler who raised both the Sun and the Moon.\n\nUnder the rule of Princess Celestia, ponies enjoyed unprecedented prosperity. A treaty of friendship was signed with the Deer of §YOlenia§!, ending their coastal raids for good. Famed explorer Meanderly Pool crossed the ocean and travelled far to the east, where she discovered the eastern pony cousins of the §CRiverlands§!. Another explorer named Coltlumbus founded §YNew Mareland§! in southern Griffonia. Eventually, Jam Wutt would invent the steam engine, heralding the beginning of Equestria's industrialisation. New cities would appear and rapidly grow as the country urbanized and modernized while wars were ended with but a few kind words. Through her benevolence and pacifism, Princess Celestia ushered in an era of peace. One that would last for all of eternity.\n\n§eOr so she thought.§!\n\nThat eternal peace has been shattered beyond repair, leaving the unprepared ponies to scramble to pick up the pieces. From the ashes of the old Equestria, §eEmpress Daybreaker§! has arisen. Born from Princess Celestia’s grief and hatred, she will let nothing stand in her way as she smites the enemies of ponykind, real or imagined. Gone are the days of tolerance and harmony. Now the only thing in Equestria’s future is a peace built on death and suffering.\n\nA new empire takes the stage - an empire beyond anything that has come before. Time will tell if this emerging superpower is just as eternal as its Empress."

 EQS_starlight_and_trixie_desc:0  "When Daybreaker rose to power, Starlight Glimmer was a reformed cult leader and Trixie Lulamoon a less than scrupulous travelling magician, and yet it was these talents that saw them rise to become the leaders of the Harmony Restoration Movement. It did not take long for both of them to learn the art of misdirection, deceit and simple ruthlessness to evade the Imperial Inquisition. This adaptiveness is why they remain when most other resistance leaders were captured or killed.\nThough their friendship is a tempestuous one, it has remained steadfast, and they have learned to play off each other. Starlight Glimmer has established herself as the strategist and the planner whereas Trixie has become (in)famous as an able tactician and guerilla commander. Their unorthodox backgrounds have informed their methods, and they managed to carry their efforts this far through these tricks.\nIt takes more than just tricks to lead a rebel army, however, and beyond the trickery and creativity stands two mares who, when all other heroes seemed to have failed, saw themselves called to step up and take over the fight. If they should fail, they know that other ponies will step up as well, because that is the Equestria they remember and will fight for.\n§YPortrait by§!: Tek"

Legends say that on the day of his birth, Hurricane’s mother dreamt that her womb was struck by a thunderbolt. She awoke to find her house had been destroyed by a hurricane, yet the winds had not disturbed a single hair on her coat. She gave birth soon after and named her child Hurricane after the storm that heralded his arrival.\n\nLike all children of the Pegasi Empire, Hurricane entered the rigorous education and training program mandated by the state the moment his wings could lift him off the ground. As Commander he would lead the Pegasi Empire to dominance over both Equus and Griffonia, laying low the griffon kingdoms and conquering as far south as modern-day Nimbusia. His conquests would open the pathway for the other tribes to settle Griffonia, using the land conquered by the pegasi in exchange for regular tribute as was custom at the time.\n\nBut the Pegasi Empire’s glory was not to last. The tension between the tribes and wars waged by Hurricane had drawn the attention of the ancient and malevolent Windigos. With the temperature dropping rapidly, Commander Hurricane was forced to take his people south into modern Equestria, but the cold would not relent. As the temperatures plummeted, Commander Hurricane entered an uneasy alliance with Princess Platinum and Chancellor Puddinghead, an alliance that would lead to the discovery of the fires of friendship and the foundation of the first unified pony nation.\n\n§YPortrait By:§!

They have banded together to speak out against the destruction of their liberty. While they may lack organisation, they have already garnered immense support through a unifying message of democracy and freedom. Thousands of ponies have now joined together on a march from Ponyville to Canterlot, demanding that Daybreaker step down so elections can be held.\n\nThe world now waits with bated breath for what the Empress will do."

They didn't have to wait long before, much to their horror, Empress Daybreaker herself soared down to meet them. Many fled immediately while those that remained prepared for a grueling fight. But much to their surprise, Daybreaker claimed she merely wished to negotiate with the organisers of the march, giving her word that none of them would come to harm.\n\nSeeing no other option the marchers agreed to Daybreaker’s terms, willing to be made martyrs for their cause if she went back on her word. But the alicorn simply invited them into Canterlot to discuss their demands over a cup of tea, provided they remained reasonable. In Daybreaker’s eyes they were entitled to air their concerns to their monarch if they wished.\n\nThe leaders of the march were flown up into Canterlot while the rest of the marchers who refused to return to their homes were provided food and tents to camp outside the city."

Many of the ponies in the march quietly backed off upon seeing the machine guns and fortifications the Imperial Royal Guard had set up, but a few brave ones decided to storm the blockade, intending to be made martyrs for their cause. But even they faltered when Empress Daybreaker herself arrived.\n\nShe wasted no time on words and conjured an immense barrier of fire in the path of the marchers. In a deafening voice she demanded that they stand down and face justice or be incinerated. The handful of ponies who hadn’t been cowed by the immense display of power attempted to shoot at the alicorn but were quickly consumed by an unnatural fire that burnt flesh, bone and magic alike, leaving nothing behind.\n\nThe rest of the marchers were forced to kneel and proclaim fealty to Daybreaker in a grand spectacle. But nopony could miss the looks of resentment and hatred on their faces. Empress Daybreaker may have crushed this group, but this was only the beginning of the Harmonist Resistance."

A small filly pulled on his fur, looking up at him with pleading eyes. Pear Jam laughed and hoisted the little filly onto his head, letting her peer over the sea of heads and wave her hoof at the alicorn monarch.\n\nEver since their home had been bombed in the opening stages of the war, Pear Jam had been forced to take his infant daughter from city to city, always just managing to stay ahead of the collapsing frontline. He’d fallen in with the millions of refugees displaced by the war, doing whatever he could to keep his daughter safe. After years of living in tents and hastily-constructed homeless shelters, Pear Jam finally returned to his home city to find a house waiting for him. It was small, built to an exact series of specifications deemed sufficient for a family of his size and identical to thousands of others, but he was just grateful to have a sturdy roof over his head. His daughter would attend school for the first time next week and he would begin work in the restored factories.\n\nDespite everything that had happened, he was optimistic about the future. Daybreaker didn’t promise to return Equestria to the way it used to be, but she promised safety and a new beginning. For Pear Jam, that was enough."

Buildings that once stood as testaments to the glory changelings could achieve when united now stood as empty husks. Above it all stood the Queen’s Tower. A year ago, it would have dominated the skyline. Changelings everywhere would look to it and be filled with pride for their nation. The tower still dominated the skyline, but now it sagged to one side like a withered tree. Flags of white and green were replaced by red and gold, now it would only remind the changelings of Vesalipolis who their new masters were.\n\nAs the ponies marched through the streets, changelings were forced from their homes and made to kneel as they passed. Heading the march was Empress Daybreaker herself, standing proud atop a tank with a wicked smile on her face. To her, it wasn’t enough to defeat the changelings. They had to be brought low and made to learn their place in the world.\n\nBeneath the shadow of the Queen’s Tower Daybreaker had gathered every changeling of note. War heroes, wealthy industrialists, genius inventors; all were made to prostrate themselves before the Empress and swear oaths of loyalty. To add insult to the injury, she heated the ground beneath their hooves, causing their shells to sizzle. They glared at the alicorn with barely restrained hatred and Daybreaker revelled in it.\n\nThe dream of Pax Chrysalia was dead."
 paxsolaris.7.d_stg:0 "It was a glorious day. The crimson banners of [This.GetNameDef] were displayed high and proud for all to see, casting a long shadow over the rubble of Stalliongrad. Great statues that once depicted the heroes of the revolution were gone, leaving the streets leading up to the Palace of the Soviets naked and exposed before the Solar conquerors. The Palace itself was barely standing, the last symbol of a people's dreams of revolution. It would not remain that way for long.\n\nStalliongrad prisoners of war were chained together and forced to keep pace behind the trucks thundering down the streets. Heading the march was Empress Daybreaker herself, standing proud atop a tank with a wicked smile on her face. To her, it wasn't enough to defeat Stalliongrad. She had to reduce their very ideology to ash beneath her hooves. Burn the experiment to the ground and leave nothing standing.\n\nDaybreaker wasted no time with words and ignited her horn. A brilliant beam of energy shot forward and hit the Palace with a deafening crack. It trembled one final time before the great tower began to slowly fall away. The earth shook as the structure collapsed, sending a cloud of debris across the city. Daybreaker didn’t even flinch as the debris impacted her shield.\n\nWhen the dust settled, her army cheered."
 paxsolaris.7.d_nlr:0 "For ‘The City that Never Sleeps’, Manehattan certainly had some lofty dreams. Dreams of usurping the rightful ruler of Equestria. Dreams planted in their mind by a creature that had the gall to betray Daybreaker twice and still call her sister.\n\nThat dream was now dead, and Luna wouldn’t get a third chance to breathe life into it. What was that old saying? Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, I’ll burn the flesh from your bones. That probably wasn’t right, but Daybreaker doubted the handful of Luna’s supporters still clinging to life would call her saying inaccurate.\n\nThe moon hung over the city. It shone weakly, for it was nothing but a pale reflection of her radiant sun. Just like Luna had been to her. It was a pity her sister couldn’t see that and instead sought respect and love she had never deserved. Daybreaker ignited her horn and the moon began to shift, dipping below the horizon to be replaced by the sun. Under the golden light of dawn, the vast number of ponies gathered at the city plaza were clearly visible. They had gathered at his spot all those months ago when Luna had shown her true colours. Now they gathered here at gunpoint to witness the death of the delusion that the moon could ever outshine the sun.\n\nDaybreaker ruled alone. As it should be."
 paxsolaris.7.d_cry:0 "The few remaining misshapen lumps of black crystal withered under the purifying glow of the sun as the Daybreaker made her way down the streets of Crystal City. She smirked at the sight. Those crystals were the relics of a deluded king who thought he could challenge a goddess for dominion over her ponies. If only he’d learnt that shadows will always yield to purifying light, maybe he would still be alive.\n\nCrystal ponies gathered in massive crowds as the tanks of [This.GetNameDef] thundered down their streets. Some cheered with jubilation, eager to be free from the shadow-king’s enslavement once again. Others maintained cautious fear, worried that they had only exchanged one tyrant for another. A handful peeked through the cracks in their curtains to watch Daybreaker pass. They hid from the sunlight like the rodents they were, fearing retribution for their actions. Daybreaker would remember them.\n\nShe levitated the Crystal Heart with her magic, placing it back in its rightful spot at the centre of the city. The crystal ponies cheered as the heart was returned, the noise shattering the last of the obsidian crystals."

Some would call her foolhardy, but this could be her only chance of finding out why the element bearers had gone silent. Failing that, the unicorn had smuggled a handgun in her saddle bags. She prayed she wouldn’t have to use it.\n\nCanterlot had certainly changed since she’d last been here. Crimson and gold banners were hung everywhere, replacing the white and blue ones she was familiar with. The Royal Guards had forsaken their traditional golden armour in favour of black, red and gold uniforms. Yet it was only after Sunset had stepped into the throne room that the greatest change became apparent. A domineering monolith of gold and ruby had replaced Celestia’s simple throne. It was partially shielded from view by a wall of fire, preventing Sunset from seeing more than a silhouette of the alicorn behind it.\n\n“It’s true, isn’t it?” Sunset breathed. Even in the frontiers of Equestria, she’d heard the rumours of what Celestia had become but never wanted to believe them. Now the evidence was undeniable.\n\n“Ah, Sunset Shimmer,” A voice boomed, seeming to come from everywhere at once. “Thank you for answering my summons."\n\nSunset could feel Daybreaker’s aura dominating the room, shrouding everything in an oppressive heat. It terrified her, but she steeled her nerves and pointed her horn at the silhouette. “What have you done with Twilight and her friends?”\n\n“You mean you don’t know?” Hollow laughter echoed across the throne room. “I’m not surprised. Twilight has been temporarily taken into custody, but the others have returned to their homes in Ponyville.”\n\n“Then why have none of them contacted me?” Sunset demanded, only to receive more laughter.

Where Celestia’s rainbow mane had reminded Sunset of the first colours of spring, the angry mass of red and yellow that had taken its place looked like a wildfire. Her eyes burned with the fury of a star as she gave the yellow mare a fanged smile.\n\n“Because they don’t trust you, my little pony,” Daybreaker said, her words cutting into Sunset like knives. “Haven’t you ever wondered why Twilight only calls upon you when she has no other option, or why she didn’t seek your aid before I captured her? She fears you, Sunset. If you had actually earnt Twilight’s trust and forgiveness, you would not have to come all this way seeking answers.”\n\nSunset struggled to hold back her tears, but it was a losing battle. Daybreaker had given voice to her deepest fears. Twilight was unwilling give Sunset her trust. She didn’t treat her like a friend, she treated her like an adversary. That thought only made Sunset feel worse. How was she supposed to redeem herself if nobody would give her a chance?\n\nAs if reading her thoughts, Daybreaker stepped forward to wrap her wing around the yellow mare. The oppressive heat was tempered into a comforting warmth that reminded Sunset of long summers spent with Celestia. She instinctively buried her face into the alicorn’s soft coat just like she’d done as a filly.\n\n“Twilight may not trust you, but I do,” Daybreaker consoled, nuzzling Sunset fondly. “Fate has forced me to look upon my actions from a different perspective and I now realise I am not blameless for what transpired. You have my forgiveness, Sunset. I only wish that you will grant me yours.”\n\nThose words brought Sunset back to the present. She recoiled from Daybreaker and drew her handgun, holding it in a shaky telekinetic grip. It now seemed woefully insufficient for killing the alicorn, but it was all the yellow mare had.\n\n“Enough talk! What do you want with me?” Sunset demanded, though her voice was wavering."

It was challenging work, but the school taught her how important it was for everypony in Equestria, even little unicorn fillies, to learn and prepare for the next great war. There would come a time when Empress Daybreaker would call upon her, and Pumpkin Cake intended to be ready.\n\nMost of the day was spent learning things like writing and mathematics, but in the morning another teacher would arrive to instruct them in solarist principles or the importance of their struggle. Today they’d been shown a movie on the rise of the Reformisten Movement. Pumpkin would never admit it, but that video had scared her. At least until her brother Pound Cake promised that when the griffons came to slaughter ponies, he’d be there to stop them and protect her. The pegasus colt had been enamoured by the tales of brave heroes fighting the enemies of Equestria. She’d seen him in the yard playing war with the other colts, fighting over who got to be Imperial soldiers and who was stuck pretending to be changelings or griffons.\n\nThe siblings had even begun applying their lessons outside of school, watching carefully for evidence of dissent or inefficiency. Their parents didn’t approve of this new behaviour, much to Pumpkin’s confusion. Pound had finally begun doing his homework and Pumpkin was top of her class. That was a good thing, right? The nice instructor said she had the makings of an engineer. Were they just disappointed neither of them wanted to be bakers?\n\nPumpkin pushed those thoughts away. No matter what her parents said, she intended to serve her nation and people as best as she could. She would not allow their disapproval to deter the unicorn from such an important task.

To answer your question, I have brought you here because I seek redemption, just like you.”\n\nSunset stepped back, the handgun trembling as she struggled to keep it aimed at the alicorn. “Explain. What do you have to be sorry for?”\n\nThat earned her a chuckle from the alicorn. “What don’t I have to be sorry for? I did nothing as Equestria grew weak and vulnerable. Now ponies are dead, and it’s all my fault. I’ve made so many mistakes, Sunset, but I intend on making things right. Starting by mending our relationship. Let’s find redemption together by making Equestria a better place for our ponies.”\n\nThe last of Sunset’s resolve crumbled and she raced forward to embrace Daybreaker, her handgun lying forgotten on the ground. The fire of the alicorn’s mane caressed her back like a warm summer’s breeze. She held the white mare tightly, afraid that if she let go, she’d wake up and realise this had all been a dream. That the one pony who offered her a real second chance still despised her.\n\n“I s-swear on your n-name, I will make you proud!” Sunset managed to say between happy sobs.\n\nDaybreaker gently pet the unicorn’s head, a satisfied smile on her face. “I know you will, Sunset. I trust you, that’s why I’m making you the first Solar Custodian. You will carry out my will and together we will lead Equestria to a brighter future. Nothing will stand in our way. How does that sound, my little pony?”\n\n“That sounds wonderful, your majesty,” Sunset bowed her head. She could hardly believe her luck. Never in her wildest dreams had she thought the solar alicorn would grant her lifelong wish of ruling a new Equestria by her side. As if reading her mind, Daybreaker smiled."

It will be temporarily shut down while my colleagues decide which ponies will have to seek employment elsewhere.”\n\n"This is an outrage! You and Celestia have no authority over universities!”\n\nNeighsay turned to elderly stallion, a smug glint in his eyes. “That’s Empress Daybreaker to you, professor, and she has changed her mind.”\n\nHe revelled in the hateful glare the dean gave him. Manehattan Polytechnic had always defied the EEA, serving as a hotbed of dissidence and republican thought. In recent years they had even taken to accepting griffons into their school, only giving Equestria’s enemies the tools they needed to destroy ponykind once and for all. Neighsay had done what he could. He’d put forward petitions, revised school curriculum and used his extensive fortune to fund grassroots movements of likeminded ponies, but Princess Celestia had opposed him every step of the way. Even when the enemies of Equestria invaded, she did nothing.\n\nAnd then came her ascension. Neighsay remembered being cautious at first, but it wasn’t long before he realised that this was the leader he'd been searching for. This was the ruler who would bring ponykind to their rightful place as masters of the world.\n\nDaybreaker didn’t just allow Neighsay to teach the truth about ponykind’s enemies.

We have lost so many in a war we never thought possible, but through it we have been hardened.

Ponyville was a bastion of harmonist thought, one that Daybreaker could not ignore. Soldiers were marching down the streets, knocking on doors and ‘insisting’ that ponies come to hear the alicorn's speech. It was disheartening to see how many left their homes with wide, excited smiles on their faces, but Mayor Mare had bigger problems to worry about. An armoured car stopped at the foot of town hall, the Empress herself standing upon it.\n\n“Ah, Mayor Mare.

She began her speech, speaking of the fallacies of the old ways and the shining future Equestria could look forward to under her new order. Mayor Mare couldn’t bring herself to pay attention. She instead found her tired eyes wandering to the crowd of ponies. Many of them looked like they were hanging on to every word, staring at the alicorn with adoring eyes. Others glared at Daybreaker with barely suppressed anger. As the speech drew to a close, Daybreaker’s closing line caught her ears.\n\n“...and to mark the beginning of Equestria's ascension, the travesty we once called a school will be leveled and a new university will be built in its place so that you, the loyal and hardworking citizens of Ponyville, can help build a brighter future for your children!” Daybreaker finished her speech and flared her wings wide. The alicorn’s horn ignited and sent a jet of fire towards the School of Friendship. It ignited like a tinderbox; the flames somehow consuming even the masonry. In only a few minutes the only thing left of the monument to the cooperation between species was a smoking pile of ash.

Something must be done.\n\nTwo proposals sit on Daybreaker’s desk. One suggests withdrawing from most of the buffalo land and concentrating on our most important outposts. This would mean we would only have nominal control over buffalo lands and give the buffalo the opportunity to aid the resistance (especially in the event of an uprising) but would be the cheapest option and wouldn't burden our soldiers. The other suggests gathering the buffalo into work camps overseen by the military. The detained buffalo will be monitored around the clock and used as hostages to pacify the others our search parties might have missed. Few would resist if it meant their friends and family would be executed in a work camp. However, this would add additional burden to our armed forces.

They were getting a kick out of this, she knew it. Why else would they make them all dig pointless holes in the middle of nowhere other than to humiliate them?”"
 paxsolaris.27.a:0 "They enjoyed seeing buffalo suffer."

 paxsolaris.28.t:0 "Hardhooves' Promise"
 paxsolaris.28.d:0 "“Why don’t you come down here and do it yourself!” Rockjoint shouted. Hardhooves didn’t know him too well, but when she arrived at the camp Rockjoint had been one of the biggest buffalo she’d ever seen. It only took a few weeks for his legs to become weak and scrawny. She didn’t know what these ponies fed them, but only the truly desperate would call it food. Despite this, he still held on to his defiant buffalo stubbornness. She watched as Rockjoint lowered his head and scrapped his hoof along the sand.\n\nBut the ponies just laughed.\n\n“Settle down, or we’ll have you marching back to camp,” A guard smirked. “And I don’t think all of you will make the journey.”\n\nRockjoint looked to the dozen other buffalo, all tired and hungry. His eyes found Elder Hardhooves and the young calf she was shielding. With a tired sigh, he hung his head in submission.\n\n“That’s what I thought," The guard sneered.\n\nHours ticked by in silence, terror pushing the buffaloes into working long after the sun had set. Stronghorn had run out of tears to cry and now worked in hopeless silence next to Rockjoint. By now the pit was deep enough to stack three buffalo. Respite came when the sound of a truck's engine reached their ears. Finally, they were going back to camp. At least there they could have something to fill their bellies and a few hours of sleep before tomorrow’s shift.\n\nEight ponies stepped out of the back of the truck, each dressed head to toe in the black, red and gold uniform of the Imperial Royal Guard. One guard stepped forward and spoke to their overseer in a hushed voice the buffalo couldn’t quite hear. The guard pointed at them, and the overseer nodded. A thought occurred to Hardhooves. If the ponies had come in the truck, how were they all getting back to camp?\n\nThe eight new guards fanned out across the pit, staring down at the buffalo with unreadable expressions. Desert wind howled a warning, but it fell on deaf ears.\n\nThe ponies drew their rifles."
 paxsolaris.28.a:0 "And all fell silent."

 paxsolaris.29.t:0 "Ad Meliora"
 paxsolaris.29.d:0 "It is done. After centuries of conflicts with pony settlers, the buffalo have finally fallen silent. This time forever. There will be no more stampeding, no more gatherings and certainly no more compromises. In a thousand years they will be nothing but a footnote in pony history books. Our oil refineries are performing well, and pony settlers are enjoying their new homes. They don't dig too deep under the barren desert sands."
 paxsolaris.29.a:0 "Such is the fate of those who oppose the will of the Empress."

 paxsolaris.30.t:0 "A Different Kind of War"
 paxsolaris.30.d:0 "Velvet Arrow cautiously peered around the double doors into the Canterlot Throne Room. A lot had changed since he last stood in this doorway. Black granite and gold had replaced marble and silver while the stained-glass windows now depicted flames, suns and scenes of past glory, all illuminated from behind by pillars of fire.\n\nYet the biggest change was the throne itself. The once welcoming dual thrones of the alicorn princesses had been replaced by one massive gold and ruby throne, almost concealed from view by a wall of fire. The throne shone with an unnaturally bright light, making it almost impossible to look at directly. It was like somepony had opened a window to the surface of the sun.\n\nDespite the intensity of the light, the temperature of the Imperial Palace somehow remained comfortably warm. It helped steady the earth pony’s nerves as he waited patiently for the meeting to adjourn so he could learn why Dotted Line had summoned him.\n\nPrince Blueblood walked to the head of the table, bowing to the throne before addressing the assembled ponies. “Very well, on to our first order of business. In the last few weeks, the resistance has vandalised five police stations, graffitied no less than a dozen administrative centres with anti-Solar propaganda and even attacked a railway station. They have shot Imperial garrisons and loyal ponies in the streets. Worst of all, they have rendered many important factories useless with strikes and sabotage. These attacks lack any form of organisation, but they prove one thing: a significant amount of ponykind are willing to take up arms against our government.”\n\n“What our Prince says is true,” Dotted Line nodded. “And the attacks are only increasing in frequency. If we allow these resistance movements to organise, we could have a full-blown revolution on our hands. With our army stretched thin across the entire nation, our chances of winning are slim.”"
 paxsolaris.30.a:0 "“We must take swift action if the empire is to prevail.”"
 paxsolaris.31.t:0 "A Chance"
 paxsolaris.31.d:0 "A long moment passed where the only sound came from the cracking fires of the throne. Then the flames shifted and the Empress turned to Dotted Line. “We need to break this resistance as soon as possible. Teach them the price of defiance. I trust you have a plan for tackling this... problem?”\n\nDotted Line bowed low. “Of course, my Empress. To combat the resistance, we need inside information on their movements. I have a plan to infiltrate one of the more active groups.”\n\n“Very well. I am putting you in charge of our counterinsurgency efforts until a permanent replacement can be found. You are dismissed,” Daybreaker’s voice echoed through the palace. Velvet Arrow backed away from the throne room doors as Dotted Line rose from his bow and made his way towards him. \n\n“You were a S.M.I.L.E agent, is that correct?” Dotted Line asked the second he passed the doorway, not wasting any time on pleasantries.\n\n“Y-Yes, that is true. Sir!” Velvet added hastily. Dotted Line was so many ranks above him he might as well have been Daybreaker herself.\n\nDotted Line frowned. “A pity most of your coworkers turned out to be traitors.”\n\n“Sir, I have nothing but the utmost loyalty to the Empress!” \n\n“Settle down kid, I was just making a comment,” Dotted Line rolled his eyes. “Given that you are one of the few agents we have left, I’m assigning you to infiltrate the Whinnyapolis resistance cell. The Empress has taken a... special interest in that particular group.”\n\nDotted Line eyed the earth pony expectantly and Velvet Arrow gulped. “It would be an honour to accept this mission, sir.”"

 paxsolaris.32.t:0 "Triangulate and Eliminate"
 paxsolaris.32.d:0 "All intelligence on resistance activity points towards wireless systems being their primary means of communication, both within the resistance itself and between the resistance and the general public. While resistance communication is all coded beyond our codebreaker’s ability to decipher quickly enough for up-to-date intelligence on resistance activity, and the propaganda broadcasts reveal nothing usable, our engineers believe they have found a way to quickly and easily trace the origin of broadcasts without actually needing to know what they say. We have already installed this triangulation technology on mobile trucks and are ready to deploy them across [THIS.GetNameDef].\n\nWhile our counterinsurgency teams all agree this technology will become invaluable to our efforts, there is a debate on how it should be used. If we strike at the resistance broadcasting stations directly, we could quickly disrupt their communications, but there is no way to do this without the resistance knowing we possess the means of tracking their radio signals. Most resistance members will go underground and stop using radios to communicate. Alternatively, we could merely mark down the location of resistance cells and use this intelligence to support other operations. This strategy will surely help us combat the efforts of the resistance, but to maintain the secrecy of this technology we must allow the broadcasting stations to continue operating."
 paxsolaris.32.a:0 "We should merely observe, identifying more resistance cells will help us in the long run."
 paxsolaris.32.b:0 "Strike hard at all broadcasting stations, we must eliminate these propaganda networks!"

 paxsolaris.33.t:0 "The Empress is Watching"
 paxsolaris.33.d:0 "“You have done well, Dotted Line,” Daybreaker gave the stallion a rare smile. He beamed at her praise, but the alicorn had already turned towards the wall of monitors, a satisfied glint in her eyes.\n\nDaybreaker was standing at the nexus of Project INSIGHT, the most extensive surveillance system the world had ever seen. It spanned every major settlement under her rule. Cameras watched the streets. Cameras watched cameras. Cameras watched ponies watching other ponies. At the centre of it all, she would see everything.\n\nFreedom was a dangerous thing. It allowed disorder to fester in the hearts of ponies. Daybreaker might have tolerated this as Celestia, but that tolerance had worn thin. Now she knew that order would serve ponykind better than freedom ever did, but order required control and control required obedience.\n\nUnlike most of her former cabinet, Dotted Line understood this simple truth. Her policy of swift reprisals for even the slightest deviance had won her the loyalty of the results-oriented Cabinet Secretary. It would seem she had not been the only one who had grown tired of inefficient bureaucracy perpetuated by lazy and indolent parasites.\n\nThere was still a decision to make. Her millennia of experience in ruling ponykind told her the control these cameras provided was fragile and limited. By exaggerating the capabilities of the surveillance network, she could intimidate ponies into compliance by using their own paranoia against them, but those same millennia had also taught Daybreaker just how easily fear could turn into hatred. Intimidating ponies into compliance would be an effective but unpopular strategy. Not to mention a part of her still rebelled at the idea of making her precious children live in fear of her. But if it forced them to give up the traitors in their midsts, surely it would all be worth it?"
 paxsolaris.33.a:0 "Of course. For safety, no price is too high."

 paxsolaris.34.t:0 "Papers, Please!"
 paxsolaris.34.d:0 "“Papers, please,” Inspector Checkmark asked the brown earth pony. The unicorn mentally steeled himself for the next interrogation. It wasn’t the first time this pony had been at the checkpoint.\n\n“Glory to Equestria, old friend! I am back again!” Junky Potato flashed a wide grin at the inspector and presented his papers. “This time everything set!”\n\nCheckmark sighed and accepted the stallion’s passport. At least this time it didn’t look like a foal had made it, though Checkmark doubted it was legitimate. But if it was a fake, he couldn't tell. Still, Checkmark couldn’t allow him entry.\n\n“You are missing an entry permit. All visitors to the Heartland region require an entry permit to enter.”\n\nJunky Potato just smiled. “You funny guy! [THIS.GetNameDef] so great, entry permit is not needed!”\n\n“I’m sorry, an entry permit is required,” Checkmark stamped the passport and handed it back.\n\n“Oh, okay. I hear you. I come back again!”\n\nSighing once again, the inspector cleared off his desk before reaching for the speaker and calling the next pony. A green pegasus mare walked up to the checkpoint. She handed him her papers and the inspector went to work checking through them.\n\n“Duration of stay?” Checkmark asked, not looking up from the papers. Name checked out, passport numbers matched.\n\n“One week,” the pegasus replied. That checked out too. He reached for the allowed stamp, then hesitated. The passport says it was issued in Bales, but the Empress’ passport program had yet to establish itself in that city.\n\n“I’m sorry ma’am, this passport is fraudulent,” Checkmark told her. His hind legs found the silent detain button beneath the desk and pressed it.\n\n“Very well,” The mare replied. She trotted away but had only travelled across the building before the checkpoint guards stopped her. The mare reached for her purse but was quickly tackled by the guards. He watched as something small and metallic slid across the ground and levitated a handkerchief to wiped away the cold sweat that had gathered on his brow. Once more he reached for the speaker."

You have one hour, no talking, pencils only and no leaving the room until the exam is complete. You may begin.”\n\nStar Dare sat down and began flipping through his booklet, nervously watching the Imperial Royal Guards out of the corner of his eye. He hastily filled in bubbles and scribbled down answers. The questions ranged from mundane common facts (“What are the six virtues that make up harmony?”) to strange (“How would you describe a thestral?”) and deeply personal (“What words would you use to describe your earliest memories?”). At the end of the hour, the Imperial Royal Guards collected each paper and stepped out of the room. The remaining ponies were quickly hurried out to make way for the next group. Star Dare exchanged looks with the others on the way out, mildly confused about the purpose of the test.\n\nA week passed and they each continued on with their lives, pushing the strange test to the back of their minds. At least until Star Dare awoke one morning to find his neighbour had disappeared in the middle of the night. He tried to push his worries aside and continue on with his day, but no matter how hard he tried to focus on his work, Star Dare couldn’t shake the feeling he was being watched."

And there are no finer ponies for this task than the cunning mares and stallions of the Imperial Inquisition. They will take up the burden of carrying the flaming sword of the Empress’ justice to the darkest corners of the world in search of all those who hide from the sun’s warm and nurturing embrace.\n\nHand-picked by Daybreaker herself, this new organisation will be the right hoof of the Empress; the instruments of her will and the edge of her sword.

Already some of our veterans have volunteered to train the new recruits in basic combat.\n\nIt is unlikely these volunteer battalions will ever see actual war, but their mere presence is enough to maintain order in frontier regions and ward off resistance attacks. If these militias grow large enough, they should even be capable of assisting the military in putting down disorganised uprisings. For now, our advisors suggest we put the newly formed National Guard to work defending our vast domain from internal attacks. The only question is where to focus their efforts. We can either prioritise government buildings, civilian settlements and factories or railways, infrastructure and military outposts."

After careful interrogation, the Inquisition managed to force some of the so-called ‘ponies’ to drop their disguise and give up the identities of other changeling spies operating in our homelands. When pressed further, the changelings admitted they use the Harmony Restoration Movement as a front to lure ponies into isolated locations and feed upon them.\n\nThe Imperial Inquisition has issued a formal statement, asking that ponies report suspicious activity to their local inquisitor to help combat the changeling threat."

In this new age of warfare, cutting off an enemy's supplies remained just as effective a strategy as it was millennia ago. For this reason, Daybreaker had instructed the Imperial Inquisition to compile a database of all known or suspected dissidents within the upper classes. In one fell swoop, she could deny the resistance their wealthy benefactors and thus their primary supply lines.\n\n“As you can see, there are hundreds of suspects within Canterlot alone,” Dotted Line reported. “I would estimate at least 70% of these ponies are or will become supporters of the Harmony Restoration Movement. It’s your call on how we should act on this information.”\n\n“Thank you, Dotted Line,” Daybreaker nodded, remembering to show her appreciation. Experience had taught her that ponies would perform better when good work was rewarded.\n\nShe agreed with the unicorn. Many of these ponies were at the very least sympathetic towards the resistance, but what to do with them? If she authorised the arrest of all ponies on this list, it would only worsen the public’s opinion of her new order. After all, it would be hard to justify the arrest of somepony based on what they might do. On the other hoof, authorising the arrest of only those proven to be working with the Harmony Restoration Movement and conducting further investigations on the rest would be better received, but would also give resistance sympathisers time to flee somewhere she couldn’t find them.\n\nAfter a moment of thought, Daybreaker made her decision."

With a tired yawn, she pushed open her door and flicked the lightswitch.\n\n“A lovely night for a bit of treason, is it?” A voice spoke from her lounge chair. Amber Drop spun around and saw a unicorn stallion sitting casually in her chair, levitating a glass of cider to his lips. He smiled at her. “I hope you don’t mind, but I cracked one of the bottles in your liquor cabinet. I couldn’t resist. 984 was such a good year for cider.”\n\nHis words jolted the pegasus back to life. “Who do you think you are? Get out of my apartment this instant!”\n\n“Oh, I don't think I will,” He drained the last of the cider then gestured to the chair opposite him. “Why don’t you sit down and we’ll discuss some things?”\n\nAmber Drop backed away slowly, but the door slammed shut behind her. With no other option, she took a seat opposite the stallion. He poured another two glasses and offered one to her. She didn't take it.\n\n“I know you distribute information for the resistance,” He said after a long moment of silence. Amber Drop opened her mouth, but he held up a hoof to stop her. “Don’t bother denying it, we know you’re guilty. Usually you would be arrested and sent for interrogation, but my friends believe we can reach an... arrangement. Savvy?”\n\n“If you think I’ll betray my friends, you’ve got another thing coming!”\n\nThe stallion placed his untouched glass of cider back on the table. “Speaking of friends, did you know one of mine is a photographer?” A manilla folder was levitated into her lap. “Would you like to some of his work?”\n\nThe pegasus opened the folder and felt her blood turn to ice. It was a house, one that she would recognise anywhere. An elderly mare was cooking dinner behind the kitchen table, oblivious to the danger lurking just outside her back door. The folder slipped through her hooves, but Amber Drop didn’t notice. The stallion leaned closer to her, a false smile plastered on his face.\n\n“Shall we discuss terms?”"

Hooves thundered on concrete as a pony raced through the warehouse, gritting her teeth as rusted wire tore into her flesh. Something dark blocked the moonlight and her heart skipped a beat. A split second later the pony was sent stumbling to the ground when a piercing pain ignited in her leg.\n\nHer first mistake had been complacency. They’d been using the same bombed-out office building as a meeting spot for over a month, their cell leader assuring them the elevation would give him enough warning to teleport everypony to safety if the Inquisition showed up. But when he was shot dead through the third story window, they had no plan to escape. That was their second mistake.\n\nLightning had arced down from the sky, blowing the roof to smithereens and knocking them all off their hooves. Cracks of rifle fire filled the room in an instant, each shot finding its mark and killing another pony with unnatural precision. Like a coward, she had abandoned her friends to the slaughter and leapt out the window, sprinting for the abandoned warehouse block as fast as her legs could carry her.\n\nNow she was dragging herself to the wall, her blood staining the grimy concrete. A shadowy figure landed gracefully behind her, the moonlight catching the black and grey of her camouflage. As the mare bled out, she looked up into the black visor of her assailant and found no mercy."

Time and time again they have been broken under us, yet they always return to be a thorn in our side. Now that Daybreaker has forced her will upon the tribes, they are once again rising up in open rebellion against us.\n\nImperial forces were quick to quell the uprisings in the east, but the situation in the jungles of the south is far more dire. Our hold on the region was already weak, but now we have been forced to withdraw from all but our most secure strongholds, surrendering the rest of those lands to the thestrals. Daybreaker has reluctantly accepted this as a temporary status quo, knowing that it would be impossible to quell the resistance in the uncharted and treacherous jungles without more ponypower and equipment than she was willing to invest.\n\nThough we now only have nominal control over the thestral homelands, few are foolish enough to believe this will not change in the near future. Daybreaker has no intention of breaking her promise of a strong and united Equestria for upstart Nightmare cultists."

 paxsolaris.46.d:0 "“Please, child, disclose your sins to us.” Came the soft voice from across the hall.\n\nStrawberry Fields stared blankly for a moment, unsure of exactly how to respond. She was surrounded by white-robed ponies and faced one in a particularly grand outfit with gold and orange trimmings. Quite understandably, the young mare was absolutely terrified of having to confess, even more so to an audience like this. She wasn’t sure of what to say. She didn’t know what this new church taught, or what was considered ‘sin’ to them. Her eyes darted nervously from pony to pony, scared to say something incorrect to these stone-still figures.\n\n“Have you partaken in your thrice-daily prayers to the holy God-Empress, child?” The highly decorated priest asked, breaking the silence a second time.\n\n“I... N-no... Is that... Am I supposed to?” She gave out, closer to squealing than to speaking.\n\nThe priest looked up, his hood no longer hiding what was simultaneously a sinister and comforting grin. He began to step away from his slightly raised podium, revealing a golden statue of Daybreaker that seemed to absorb then radiate sunlight from a large stained-glass window at the back wall of the church.\n\n“You see... There is always something to repent for, child. Go, learn and do as her script commands of us. You will return tomorrow.” The stallion said calmly, offering a book with the all-too-familiar symbol of the God-Empress emblazoned on the cover.\n\n“B-but... In one... Just one night?” Strawberry returned, taking the book with shaky hooves once he was close enough.\n\nIt was at that moment when the air about the priest suddenly changed. A fire in his character enflamed and the colours on his robes brightened as he drew a blade from his cloak. The gleaming metal burned her eyes to look at, but that was better than thinking about how close it was to her throat."

 paxsolaris.47.t:0 "The Cycle"
 paxsolaris.47.d:0 "It had been some time since Strawberry Fields had learnt the texts off by heart. Threat of force had been more than enough to motivate the young mare at first, but after beginning her journey to enlightenment, she found herself unable to stop. Strawberry had read and reread the word of the Empress until every proverb and prayer was burned into her mind. It was as if her eyes had finally opened after a lifetime of blindness. She could see the world in perfect clarity. See ponykind ascending to glory under the light of their mighty sun.\n\nNow Strawberry was one of countless hundreds worshipping at the temple, watching as the unenlightened of Equestria were tasked or punished by the priest. Many were cut, some were scarred and others had even been dispatched entirely right in front of her, but by now that was simply routine for her and the rest of the God-Empress’ chosen. It was the task of those blessed by Daybreaker and her teachings to spread her divine wisdom.\n\n“Please, child, disclose your sins to us,” Came the voice of the priest.\n\n“I... I had dinner with one of the dark ones,” An old stallion confessed.\n\nThe silence that followed was deafening. Nopony in the room had expected to hear such a gross and blatant flaunting of the God-Empress’ words. You shouldn’t, no, you simply couldn’t speak to a thestral anymore, let alone spend an evening with one to eat their dark and unholy meals. Such an act was a crime unforgivable, a choice that renounced your prior convictions to Daybreaker.\n\n“I had dinner with a bat; we talked for hours and hours and drank till we fell asleep. I’ll never forget the night as long as I live,” He continued, unphased by the cloud of judgement around him.\n\nA beam of plasma cut the old stallion down before he could even blink. His ashes drifted lazily to the tiled floor, but the blackened bones remained held in the telekinetic grip of the priest. He beckoned Strawberry Fields to join him on the podium, to take his place in judging the souls of the unenlightened while he disposed of the latest sinner. She nodded, stepping up to the podium as a terrified green mare stepped through the ashes of her predecessor.\n\nStrawberry Fields opened her wings wide, giving the mare a warm smile."

A weapon she herself had helped developed, poised and ready to be released straight into the warren of the Diamond Dogs. She’d never even heard of these creatures, let alone had enough experience with them to deem them deserving of a fate like this. They wouldn’t be able to escape, this was the only unblocked warren exit for miles around. It would be like shooting fish in a barrel.\n\nA nervously shaking hoof slowly made its way to the large red button that was serving as the ‘detonator’ here in the control room. Click.\n\nJust like that, huge volumes of a mustard-yellow substance surged into homes of the sleeping Diamond Dogs. It filled their lungs and choked the life out of every victim it came across. The gas burned their skin and tainted their eyes with a horrible yellow pus. A series of seismic listening devices buried in the ground recorded the screams as one by one the Diamond Dogs breathed their last. A few of the engineers cried, others tried to block the sound anyway they could, but Tulip stood rooted to the spot, listening as the guttural cries of agony faded away.\n\nBeside her, lead scientist Oak was paying close attention the sound of the screams. He grinned. Not only was this test a success, it was a staggering one. Within a few hours there was not a single whimper or dying snarl heard emanating from those unholy warrens. Indeed, they were so empty and full of corpses they would be more accurately referred to as catacombs. He would send a team to recover a few bodies for dissection later. Now was a time for celebration. He turned to Tulip and gave her a nod."

 paxsolaris.49.d:0 "“Atten-shun!”\n\nPrivate Steel Feather stood straight, his ears ringing from shout. He could hear the sergeant’s boots clicking on the concrete floor behind the row of soldiers but didn’t dare turn around to check. Not that he could’ve seen anything with the blindfold over his eyes. The door creaked open and Steel Feather heard something heavy being dragged into the bunker.\n\n“In all my years I don’t think I’ve seen a more pathetic bunch of limp-fetlocked sorry excuses for ponies! If you lot are supposed to be the next generation of Equestrian soldiers we might as well just lie down with our asses in the air! Do you want that?”\n\n“Sir! No, sir!” The recruits shouted.\n\n“You are not civilians anymore. You are killers! You will be expected to die for this nation and slaughter its enemies without mercy! Can you do that?”\n\n“Sir! Yes, sir!”\n\n“Then it’s time to prove it! Remove your blindfolds!”\n\nSteel Feather unwrapped the blindfold and felt his blood turn cold. A bruised stallion knelt across from the row of soldiers, her hooves bound tightly with chains and mouth gagged with a dirty rag. His green eyes were wide and tearful, silently pleading for mercy. The pieces clicked together with horrifying clarity. This would be their test.\n\n“This little shit was caught spying for our enemies,” The sergeant said as he walked up to the gagged pony, shaking him roughly. “He is a traitor to the Empress. Each of you will have one minute to show this pathetic specimen what we think of traitors. If I see any of you go soft, it’ll be you in the chains.”\n\nThe sergeant undid the gag, allowing the stallion to speak. “Please! I have a family! You can’t do this!”\n\n“Private Steel Feather! You’re up first!”\n\nThe pegasus trembled as he approached the crying stallion. His heart clenched as the stallion looked up at him with wide, tearful eyes.\n\n“My name is Rose Green! Please, I have two daughters! You can’t kill me!”"

 SOL_benevolent_civilian_event_description_0:0 "While Daybreaker’s impact on the Equestrian economy is generally considered to be positive, recent reports have arrived that help quantify just how much her policies have changed things. The report states that many high-paying jobs have become available, driving the unemployment rate in numerous states to record lows. Cost of living has also dropped significantly, allowing for more ponies to afford homes earlier in their lives. Experts predict a sharp population increase in the affected regions over the next few years."
 SOL_benevolent_civilian_event_description_1:0 "Early this morning the Imperial garrison of Trotberg were awakened by a celebration the local ponies had thrown together as thanks for driving down the crime rate. Towns like Trotberg in regional Equestria have always struggled with entrenched criminal syndicates using them to shelter their assets and escape the police force of larger cities, but thanks to the efforts of our soldiers crime in these regions have been driven to a record low. Gangs that once prowled the streets have been killed, imprisoned or cowed into compliance. The major of Trotberg credits Empress Daybreaker’s tough stance on even petty crime for decreasing the number of muggings and burglaries threefold. Judging from the cheers the garrison received, the ponies of her town share this opinion."
 SOL_benevolent_civilian_event_description_2:0 "Yesterday even an inspection was conducted on all barracks in the capital region as part of the hunt for resistance activity. Nothing incriminating was found, but there were certain other items that were considered to be worthy of note. Apparently, the local garrison has been struck with a ‘Daybreaker craze’, for lack of a better word. Numerous drawings of the Empress were discovered among the barracks, depicting her in a way one general described as ‘provocative’. Some pictures were chosen to be sent to the Imperial Royal Guard so they could give a verdict on whether this would be allowed or not, but they appear to have disappeared on transit.\n\nPerhaps the oddest find was a pony-sized pillow with the likeness of Empress Daybreaker on it. The purpose of this pillow is unclear, but it has been sent to the Inquisition despite the protests of Barracks D-14."

A local griffon living in the town was discovered to be an informant for the Griffonian Empire by the local police force. Rather than turn the griffon over to the Imperial authorities, the local ponies decided to take matters into their own hooves. They wasted little time on a trial and moved straight to a brutal public execution. The griffon was dragged out of his home and then burnt alive. A few outraged citizens criticized the local garrison for doing nothing as these events unfurled, with some guards even accused of joining the crowd for the burning, but most of the local ponies expressed silent approval.

 paxsolaris.51.d:0 "The teeming masses of ponies trembled under the burning gaze of the fiery alicorn. Everyone had heard the rumours. Mysterious lights in the sky. Soldiers abducting people in the middle of the night. Nervous generals telling stories of a monster of fire and hatred. They had come to hear Celestia dismiss them, but now stood terror-stricken before the living proof that all those dreadful rumours were true.\n\n“My loyal subjects, do not be afraid!” Celestia’s words filled the crowd with an alien warmth. “You have no reason to fear me. Even if I have changed, I am still here to protect and watch over you. Gaze upon this new form, for it will be the one that tears to shreds the enemies at our gates! The days where I would offer a hoof to a world hellbent on hurting my beloved ponies are over! Now is the time for them to be reminded why they once feared the sun’s chosen children!”\n\nCelestia took to the skies, hovering in the sky above them like a second sun. She cast her light across the crowd, forcing them to look away. But when their eyes adjusted, the light no longer felt harsh. It felt comforting, like the tender embrace of a mother. It soothed their fears and inflamed their passion. One by one, they each turned back to their princess.\n\n“Changelings, griffons, traitors, it matters not. I will leave them all trembling at my hooves, begging for the mercy they never showed us! I will make them watch as their upstart nations are broken and everything they have ever loved crumbles to ash! Under my light, ponykind will forge a new path, one that will bring our nation the power and glory we have always deserved! We will sweep across this world like a storm of fire, annihilating all who would dare to oppose us! The very earth will fear our wrath, and Tartarus itself will bar its gates for fear of us kicking them down!”\n\nA few ponies began to stomp in agreement. It began slowly, but soon the palace grounds were filled with the sounds of applause.\n\n“Let the coming months serve as the gauntlet of fire through which we will cleanse ourselves of weakness! Let the parasitic changelings and scheming griffons know our wrath! For today, the Solar Empire is born! And I, Empress Daybreaker, will bring you eternal victory!”"

 paxsolaris.52.t:0 "Paramilitary Status Report"
 paxsolaris.52.d:0 "Pertaining to: The loyalty and effectiveness of paramilitary volunteers as an interim military.\n\nAbstract: Out of the hundreds of different organisations that have pledged their support to Empress Daybreaker, four stand out both for their distinctive size, coherent command structure and impressive degree of training. These four have direct command over 60% of the paramilitary forces pledging their support to Daybreaker and hold influence over half the remaining.\n\nThe one most useful to our cause is the Equestrian Future Society, a mainstream nationalist party founded and led by the EEA Head Chancellor Neighsay. They believe in a doctrine of pony supremacy and have a wide support base across societal stratums. The EFS has no existing loyalty to Daybreaker, but could be easily persuaded into supporting her through promises of Equestrian expansion and increased militarism.\nRecommendation: Integrate paramilitary leaders into the official chain of command.\n\nThen there is the Celestial Church, a widespread religious organisation that worships Celestia as a goddess. Loyalty of the various regional churches varies wildly. Many ecclesiarchs have declared their support of Daybreaker, while others see her as a pretender or corruption of their goddess. The Celestial Church militias have the least training, but are the most numerous.\nRecommendation: Closely monitor. Assign loyal commanders as overseers.\n\nThere is also the Aztlan Brotherhood, a militant nationalist group modelled after the old Aztlan Empire. They have extensive support in the Tenochtitlan Basin and are closely linked with the Neighuan Priesthood, which maintains de-facto control over the region. They have been the traditional rivals of the thestral tribes and have attempted to spread their militant and fanatical sun-worshipping culture to all of ponykind numerous times. Even now, there are those who long for the days where they could sacrifice nonbelievers in Celestia's honour.\nRecommendation: Assign Aztlan Brotherhood soldiers to enforce the loyalty of less reliable paramilitary groups.\n\nFinally there is the Order of the Purifying Sun, a splinter of the Aztlan Brotherhood but one powerful enough to be worthy of note. This group is the smallest of the four, but stands out as having the most training. They have a very limited support base among isolated communities of the southeast jungles, but the supporters they do have are fanatical and very well trained. The group is isolated and thus their exact doctrine is mostly unknown, but they have declared their loyalty to Daybreaker.\nRecommendation: Investigate at a later date. Assign to the frontiers of our territory to minimise damage if they prove disloyal."

 paxsolaris.53.d:0 "“I say, what on earth are you all doing here? This is private property! Remove yourselves from my estate this instant!” The stallion ordered.\n\nDuke Palaver was not a particularly important figure in any real sense, but he was a wealthy member of the low nobility in Equestria. He had just returned home from a trip to the town for groceries, only to discover a band of stallions and mares dressed in military uniforms carting his possessions out of his house and into several khaki-coloured trucks.\n\n“New law. All property can be subjected to random investigation and potential seizure for the good of Equestria.” Their commanding officer explained, gesturing to the seized items. “These are classified as luxury items and thus prohibited. They belong to the Empire now.”\n\n“I simply must protest the vulgar intrusion! You! Drop that vase! That is a priceless family heirloom you’re so jauntily stealing away!” The duke galloped forward, only to be shoved back by one of the soldiers.\n\n“If you do not comply with the will of the Sun-Empress then we will use force to impose her will upon you. The choice is yours.” The soldier returned, stepping over the old stallion and continuing back to his truck.\n\n“But this is absurd! When has that tyr- ahem, Her Majesty needed to steal from her own subjects to get by? Please, can you just leave a pensioner in peace?” Palaver begged.\n\nBut they could not, and indeed would not. After several of the young soldiers readied their weapons and ordered him to stop interfering with their business, the duke could do nothing but sit and watch as they snatched up his most prized and valued possessions. When the pony was finally allowed to return to his abode and put away his groceries, the house was a barren wasteland compared to what it had been when he left that morning. Paintings, furniture, glass and silverware were all gone. They’d even cracked into his vault with a few well-placed shots from a trench gun."

At least they all have the same symptoms,” She returned, taking a moment aside to breathe and rest her chitinous hooves.\n\n“Hah! Welcome to the healthcare industry! I didn’t get these bags under my eyes by working a normal nine-till-five, that’s for sure. Though... On the note of them all having similar symptoms... I must admit that’s rather worrying. We could be dealing with a disease outbreak. But hey, there are worse things to have than an itchy rash.”\n\n“I’m not sure. The infected are all connected to the prisoners the ponies released. It seems... off, don’t you think? Too coincidental. I don’t know, maybe I’m grasping at straws.” The young bug sighed.\n\nShe was interrupted by an ear-splitting scream. The pair immediately dropped their uneaten lunch and rushed toward the sound, soon joined by several other members of staff. They were the first to see the victim, save for the patients adjacent to the poor creature who were either covering their ears or outright cowering. The changeling, once a proud infiltrator, was now writhing on his hospital bed. A nurse galloped over and tried to comfort him, but there was little she could do. They couldn’t even administer a ketamine shot to quieten the bug without risking his safety.\n\n“Doctor! His... His shell!” The assistant yelled over the horrifying noise.\n\nThe doctor could only watch in mute horror as cracks began to appear along the exoskeleton of the patient. Each crack was punctuated by a gut-wrenching tearing noise that noling should ever hear. As the cracks grew wider, viscera began to spill out, all coated in a foul fungal growth. The bed was soon soaked in semi-luminescent blood, fungus and the poor changeling’s intestines. He gave one final scream before falling silent."

 paxsolaris.56.d:0 "The ponies of Acornage were excited to see their kin again. After months of having the love sucked out of them by their changeling occupiers, it was a relief to see Equestrian soldiers marching through the streets. Colts bounded over to meet their liberators while fillies brought out any spare food that had been saved from rationing.\n\nThe adults were less excited. They knew what had happened to their home. They knew about Daybreaker and the policies and ideas she had forced upon the nation. In a way, they were scared. Terrified even. The hope they had held on to so tightly still stood, but it had been tarnished by the knowledge that they would never be able to go back to the way things had once been. Those trucks, those tanks, those planes... they were emblazoned with an unfamiliar flag that only served to remined them of just how different things would be from now on.\n\n“Dad! Dad! Have you seen the tanks?! They’re so... big and loud and just awesome! I want to drive one when I join the army!” A young pony exclaimed brightly to his father.\n\n“The army? Thought you wanted to go into engineering. Well, you’re young yet; it’s up to you what you want to do when the time comes, I suppose,” He returned with a stony face.\n\nIn a few years, his son might not have a choice in the matter. As the war had worsened for their occupiers, it had become less and less unusual to see changelings far too young for service clutching rifles in their shivering hooves. Would Daybreaker do the same?\n\nThe stallion sighed and went back to preparing lunch for the family, letting his son run back outside to talk with the soldiers. He refused to worry about hypotheticals. Yesterday, his greatest fear had been that one of those damn bugs would take too much love and leave his wife or son in a permanent coma. It had already happened to so many of his friends. Compared to that, how bad could Daybreaker be? The world he grew up in may never return, but at least Daybreaker’s world was safe."

 paxsolaris.62.d_1:0 " With the discovery of large untapped oil reserves in the buffalo lands comes waves of immigration as ponies from all over Equestria move south to seek their fortune. This surge of pony migrants and workers has forced us to re-evaluate our administration of these states.  While our policy on the buffalo has thus far been to only retain de-jure control over most of the region, this would not provide adequate protection for our settlers. Three options have thus been outlined for creating a civilian administration.\n\nDespite substantial buffalo resistance, most have quietly accepted solar rule. Nopony is deluded enough to believe they are happy with their new overlords, but our hooves-off administration policy has kept them from widespread rebellion. If we were willing to surrender some of the newly discovered oil fields to the buffalo tribes and let them reap the profits, it would keep them comfortable enough to prevent too much conflict.\n\nAlternatively, we could round up the buffalo and concentrate them into easily policed prison-colonies. This method would keep most of the land open to settlement but at significant cost to the state. It would also create long-term challenges with buffalo resistance groups.\n\nFinally, there is the option forwarded by the Imperial Royal Guard, calling for the immediate culling of the buffalo. According to them, the former buffalo states could flourish into model solar states if their native population were to be cleared away."

Waves crashed against the shore, only to be beaten back by the steel titans of the Imperial Solar Navy. The alicorn could hardly feel the rocking of the water beneath her on the floating behemoth she stood upon. The ISN Daylight was a mighty vessel, built larger than any carrier had ever been built before. Aircraft lined the deck, bristling with torpedoes that would puncture the heart of any fleet who dared oppose her. She was designed by Equestria’s brightest minds to not only rule the seas, but to rule the skies above it as the undisputed master of all the light touched. Daybreaker grinned to herself."

 paxsolaris.64.t:0 "Law and Order"
 paxsolaris.64.d:0 "As the shackled ponies were led out into the courtroom, Daybreaker hid her interest behind a mask of indifference. It was a skill that would take the average pony decades to master, but it came as easily as breathing to the ancient alicorn. She swept her gaze across the row of prisoners, taking in every detail, from the tension in their legs to the beads of sweat on their foreheads. It was easy to tell who was guilty and who was innocent, but that hardly mattered right now.\n\nIt had been her idea to have a select few captured resistance leaders stand trial for their crimes. She would be right in having these traitors executed, but this trial was not for their benefit. It was for the benefit of the dozens of ponies that had come to watch the proceedings and the countless thousands who would watch via television. Her ponies were mortal and fragile, incapable of understanding the world as Daybreaker did, but the alicorn was willing to take their sensibilities into account and keep the illusion of due process.\n\nAs the clerk finished reading out the charges levied against a burly pegasus stallion, she turned to Daybreaker, waiting for her verdict. Truthfully, Daybreaker hadn’t listened to a single word the secretary had said. She already knew this stallion had led a resistance cell responsible for smuggling ponies wanted by the Inquisition out of Canterlot. The only reason he’d been selected as one of the dozen ponies who Daybreaker would personally judge was because the public could sympathise with him. Granting him a lenient sentence would do wonders for her image.\n\n“I sentence you to five years in the Canterlot Penitentiary,” Daybreaker announced. Just as expected, the hard glares of the assembled crowd had been softened by her verdict. Now came the other reason Daybreaker had decided to put on this charade.\n\nThe next prisoner was a thestral mare who’d been caught firebombing the home of a solar governor. She was foreign, abrasive and had the blood of a young family on her hooves. The perfect victim to remind ponies that her mercy had limits. She gave a nod to the clerk."

Her tone was neutral, but Daybreaker could hear the confusion in her voice. No doubt she wondered why the empress had summoned a minister of finance for tea.\n\n“Indeed I did,” Daybreaker smiled, leaving her teacup untouched on the table. “You see, I recently tasked Grand Inquisitor Sparkle with investigating a few key figures in Canterlot. Would you like to know what she discovered, Blossom? Or should I call you Gloriosa?”\n\nThe unicorn’s pupils shrank to pinpricks and she slowly backed away; her composure momentarily gone.\n\n“I... I don’t know what you’re talking about. I-” Crimson magic seized her throat, leaving the unicorn gasping for air.\n\n“Don’t test my patience, Blossom. I could fill a book with a list of treasonous acts you and your little clique have committed. I’m giving you thirty seconds to tell me why I shouldn’t burn you all alive. Don’t waste them.”\n\nDaybreaker released the unicorn, letting her take loud breaths as she tried to force air back into her lungs. Slowly, she got back to her hooves, trying to swallow the lump in her throat. Her next words to the alicorn would decide if she lived or died.\n\n“If you wiped us out, you’d have to make do without half of your supporters in Canterlot. You may be able to cow mudponies into submission, but unicorns are smart enough to recognise a bluff. If you were going to kill us, you would’ve done it already.”\n\nViolet Blossom met the alicorn’s hateful glare, not backing down even as Daybreaker drew herself to her full height.\n\n“That said, we don’t have to be enemies,” She continued. “Simply let unicorns take our rightful place in Equestria and you will have our loyalty.”\n\nDaybreaker paused to consider her words before providing a response."

I do not tolerate those who would divide ponykind against itself. You exist because you are useful to me. Don’t ever forget that.”\n\n“Oh trust me, I won’t,” Blossom forced her face into an impartial mask. The alicorn gave no response, so she took that as her cue to leave. As her footsteps faded away, Daybreaker, glanced over to the corner of her room.\n\n“You may come out now.”\n\nThe air shimmered as Twilight dispelled the invisibility bubble, stepping out of her crouch to approach the older alicorn.\n\n“What are your orders?” She asked.\n\n“Nothing, for now,” Daybreaker frowned. “As much as I hate it, destroying the Cornucopia Society would create more problems than it would solve. I’ll speak to Dotted Line about training replacements, just keep a close eye on the existing members.”\n\nTwilight nodded, glaring at the doorway Blossom had left from."

Don’t pretend to be loyal to me. If the changelings ruled Canterlot, you’d be courting them instead. When I ascended, I swore I would destroy the system that stifled the potential of my ponies. Now you’ve given that system a face. An extremely flammable face.”\n\nBlossom’s eyes bulged in their sockets as magic squeezed the air from her lungs. Daybreaker laughed and slammed the unicorn into a wall. The noble tensed as the alicorn laid a hoof against her horn, running it along the length.\n\n“All that arrogance, for this? I wonder, what would happen if I-” Daybreaker pressed her hoof against the horn and was rewarded by a sickening snap. Blossom opened her mouth to scream, but all that could escape her lips was a weak gasp. The alicorn smiled and her crimson magic disappeared, letting Blossom collapse to the ground.\n\n“Tell me, Gloriosa. How useful are you now?”\n\nThe mare didn’t respond. She was too busy wailing in pain, trying in vain to stem the blood flowing from the stump that was once her horn. Daybreaker ignored her suffering and nodded to the corner of the room.\n\n“You may come out now.”\n\nThe air shimmered as Twilight dispelled the invisibility bubble, stepping out of her crouch to approach the older alicorn.\n\n“What are your orders?” She asked.\n\n“Interrogate Blossom on the identities of the remaining Cornucopia Society members, then kill them. I’ll speak to Dotted Line about pulling in some temporary replacements from the other cities. It’s not ideal, but it will do for now.”\n\nTwilight nodded, glaring at the crying mare without a hint of sympathy."

This foundry was a city of fire and machinery, larger than anything the world had seen before and capable of producing more steel in a month than some countries would in decades.\n\nThe ground shuddered as a massive metal ladle was lowered next to her. It leaned forward, pouring the bright yellow molten metal into the long ingot molds. Daybreaker stepped forward and placed her hoof under the stream, feeling the comforting warmth as she allowed herself to be lost in thought.\n\nEvery single detail of the megafoundry was carefully controlled by a small army of workers, all eager for their first day on the jobsite. It dawned on the alicorn that she had a lot in common with these workers. They create order and purpose out of the mundane and chaotic."

The spokesmares of the deserters have stated their intentions are to live out their lives in peace so long as the empress respects their decision. While many are understandably furious, Daybreaker has decided against taking direct action. She knowns that many of these deserters are beloved war heroes and that killing them would be a terrible blow to her image.

At first the Inquisition searched for links between the ponies discovered with the propaganda, but were unable to find anything. In fact, they all appeared to be model citizens. From even a quick glance at their profiles, you would believe these ponies to be pious supporters of Empress Daybreaker."
 ArrestPropagandaLocation2:0 "A few weeks ago, [SOL_arrest_event_target.GetName] inquisitors began detecting resistance broadcasts. Following standard procedure, they triangulated the location and went to investigate only to find nothing. After days of trying, it was eventually determined that the broadcasting array must be mobile, moving too quickly for the inquisitors to pin down its exact location."
 ArrestPropagandaLocation3:0 "Oddly enough, the resistance pamphlets in [SOL_arrest_event_target.GetName] were not discovered by the police or the Inquisition. Instead, a loyal pony turned it in. He claims to have found the pamphlet at the foot of his front door, but nopony on the street has claimed to have seen anything else out of the ordinary."
 ArrestPropagandaLocation4:0 "The resistance pamphlets were discovered circulating among the workers in one of [SOL_arrest_event_target.GetName] industrial sectors as part of a routine factory inspection. The inspector called the Inquisition, who later identified the pamphlets as belonging to an anarchist group believed to be operating nearby."
 ArrestPropagandaLocation5:0 "A spy operating within a local resistance cell reported that resistance activists have begun to coordinate their efforts by passing along coded maps. Interestingly, these pamphlets have been carefully designed to appear as highly-detailed maps of the city to the untrained eye, but actually serve as lists of meeting spots for local resistance agents."
 ArrestPropagandaLocation6:0 "Unlike most propaganda discovered by the Inquisition, this latest wave of propaganda appears to be encoded with a very sophisticated algorithm. It is believed that these encoded messages are later decoded and broadcast along the usual channels to the public."
 ArrestPropagandaLocation7:0 "One week ago, inquisitorial assets operating within a small-scale resistance cell discovered that the cell leader was receiving coded messages through a telegraph line. The Inquisition managed to wiretap the line used by the cell, but our asset reports that other cells are using similar means to communicate across [SOL_arrest_event_target.GetName]. Somehow, the H.R.M. has managed to install their own telegraph lines parallel to our own."
 ArrestPropagandaLocation8:0 "One loyal pony came forward with hundreds of resistance pamphlets he claims to have found stuffed into a crate of peaches he’d bought from a local market. It is believed that this was a mistake, but does indicate that the local H.R.M. cells are using what appears to be produce boxes to smuggle documents and propaganda into the city."
 ArrestPropagandaLocation9:0 "These pamphlets were discovered in a military base by a sergeant following up on an anonymous tip from one of his soldiers.

Foolish traitor, thinking he would be safe from the Empress’ justice in her own church."
 ArrestPropagandaWin2:0 "The train driver confessed to having installed a broadcasting array into one of the carriages of her cargo train, using the mobility it provided to confuse our triangulation equipment. It had been a clever plan, but not clever enough to fool the Imperial Inquisition."
 ArrestPropagandaWin3:0 "The delivery mare confessed to using her mail route as a way of distributing pamphlets made by the H.R.M. to the neighbourhoods of [SOL_arrest_event_target.GetName]. At first, she’d remained tight-lipped, but cracked quickly once Winter Star mentioned the name of her husband. It pleased him to know simple threats still worked wonders."

 ArrestPropagandaWin5:0 "Needless to say, Winter Star had received a lot of odd looks when he suggested one of [SOL_arrest_event_target.GetName]’s top urban developers was a resistance agent, but who else could have been so masterfully selecting meeting spots in overlooked and hard to reach parts of the city? If only she she’d considered that her own comrades might be spies, maybe she’d still be free."
 ArrestPropagandaWin6:0 "With a bit of ego-stroking, the mathematician began loudly bragging about how he’d created an ‘unbreakable’ algorithm to code the messages of the local resistance cell. Solving the equation would’ve taken the average pony months. Unless of course they had a computer to do the number crunching for them. Winter Star had taken particular pleasure in telling him that."
 ArrestPropagandaWin7:0 "The terrified electrician hadn’t lasted long under interrogation before admitting to having secretly laid telegraph lines running parallel to the city power grid. She’d reluctantly given them a map of all telegraph lines in the state. Winter Star smiled to himself. He’d be instructing his team to wiretap those very soon."
 ArrestPropagandaWin8:0 "After an hour of driving, the Inquisitiors had finally returned back to base with an angry mare struggling in her handcuffs. She had lasted longer than the average pony, but with the threat of the inquisitors returning to her farm and taking one of her siblings, the mare finally relented and told them how she would hide resistance intel in her produce to smuggle it into the city. It was almost laughable how a simple act of fate had led to one of these crates ending up in the hooves of an unsuspecting customer."
 ArrestPropagandaWin9:0 "It did not take long for the army cook to crack under torture and admit to sending messages in and out of the base concealed in MREs. The Inquisition had arrested his co-conspirators within the hour, bringing the total number of traitors captured to four. A successful day by any metric."
 ArrestPropagandaWin10:0 "Winter Star knew he was in for a long day the moment he laid eyes on the stallion dragged into the building. He claimed to be a ‘visionary musical artist’ of some new style called ‘jazz’ the inquisitor could just tell was going to be forgotten in a few years. Thankfully he quit bragging once the interrogators got to work. Soon enough he was giving them everything he knew."
 ArrestPropagandaWin11:0 "It had taken them two days to locate the artist responsible for the graffiti, since the stallion had no address or listed place of work. After long hours of asking local vagrants and public service workers they finally found him camping out in one of the local parks. The artist was infuriatingly vague, refusing to cooperate with any servants of ‘the mare’. It was amazing how quickly his tone changed after an hour-long waterboarding session. "
 ArrestPropagandaWin12:0 "The socialite had needed to be muscled through the door by no less than three inquisitors. She had complained loudly the whole time, calling them brutes and savages. Winter Star could still feel his ears ringing. To his surprise, she had lasted a lot longer than he expected under interrogation but was soon giving up the names of the rich benefactors she had persuaded to support the resistance."

An emergency order was given by the city mayor, forcefully evacuating thousands of ponies at risk of inhaling dangerous toxic fumes. Firefighters were ordered to do whatever possible to contain the fire, but when they arrived it was already far too late. The struggle lasted long into the night before pegasi managed to gather enough rain clouds to extinguish the fire. Post-crisis investigation conducted by the Inquisition suggest this blaze was deliberately started by H.R.M. agents."

The [SOL_resistance_attack_target_true_temp.GetName] inquisitors issued an official apology, stating that a terrified security guard had called them in after a group of ponies were spotted sabotaging the steelworks.

 paxsolaris.83.d:0 "Teleporting is an undeniably useful skill, so it is no wonder that many of our top commanders have begun theorising on ways in which it could be applied to warfare. Empress Daybreaker herself has provided input in the debate, recognising that only a fraction of unicorns possess the magical strength necessary to easily teleport and thus only one of the proposed strategies could be implemented effectively. After much debate, only two strategies remain. The first calls for unicorn shock troopers to be trained in teleporting deep behind enemy lines, striking where they are weakest. The other proposes that teleportation be used by field medics to quickly withdraw wounded soldiers from the frontlines so that they can be treated, potentially saving thousands of lives."

How low was the fuel gauge? Not that it mattered much, but it was low; far too low to consider returning to rearm. He’d been overconfident again. One more enemy aircraft, then another and then another until it was too late to go back. The pony looked back at the parachute strapped to his ejector seat and furrowed his brow.\n\n“No. Not today. It’s time.” The stallion said to himself, doing his best to reassure the voice in his head that was screaming at him to at least try and make it home.\n\nHe yanked the stick to the side, pulling away from the fighter he’d been chasing and entered a nosedive straight towards an enemy cruiser with a determined look in his eyes. Several planes noticed what he was doing and peeled off to intercept, but it was already far too late. The speed and momentum he’d gained could not be stopped. The plane’s engine spluttered and died as the density of air became too much for the technology to handle. There was no going back now. At this speed the wings of the aircraft would be torn off if he tried to pull up from the dive.\n\nWithout the engine and the sound of gunfire, it was quiet. Too quiet. Time seemed to slow as the deck of the cruiser grew closer and closer. Hold the stick. Breathe. Stick. Breathe. Breathe. Stick. Breathe. Don’t think about touching the throttle. Stick. Breathe. Breathe. Breathe. Breathe. Stick. Breathe. Don’t look left. Breathe. Don’t look right. Breathe. Stick. Breathe. Think of the Empress. Grit your teeth. Breathe. Stick. Breathe. Picture your family. Think of how proud they’ll be. Breathe. Stick. Close your eyes. Breathe. Pray."

 paxsolaris.85.d:0 "“In all of your omnipotent wisdom, surely you can see that the ponies of Equestria need your light?” The bishop prostrated herself at the foot of Daybreaker’s throne. “We will always be you humble servants, my radiant goddess.”\n\n“That will be all, Bishop Springbreeze,” Daybreaker spoke up. “I will consider your offer. You may leave.”\n\nSpringbreeze looked like she wanted to say something, but she bowed her head and quickly retreated, not once meeting her empress’ gaze. The alicorn watched her leave with an unreadable expression, her mind already whirling with thoughts. The solar church had seen a surge in new members since her ascension. Ponies were drawn to the future she offered and flocked to those who claimed to speak in her name. It was no surprise to the ancient ruler that the bishops had finally worked up the courage to ask for official recognition.\n\nYet she found herself at a loss. As Celestia, she had always kept her distance from the Celestial Church. She wanted to be seen as a protector and mother to ponykind, not their goddess. Daybreaker had given up on many dreams when she ascended, but that was one of the few she still selfishly held on to. It seemed the world wouldn’t even give her that small mercy.\n\nDaybreaker certainly didn’t feel like a goddess. Sure she had the power of one, but a goddess didn’t make mistakes. A goddess wouldn’t have let her children needlessly die for so long. There was not a single villain in the world responsible for as many pony deaths as she was, but ponykind needed a goddess. They needed something perfect to aspire towards, even if it was a lie. At the same time, Daybreaker was not blind to the consequences. Taking this path would cause her ponies to suffer. Forced conversions, fanaticism, the destruction of the last vestiges of her precious Equestria. Daybreaker had already done so much, but could she give up on the last of her dreams and inflict more suffering on her children?"

You have been assigned the most holy task of vanquishing the enemies of our eternal nation!” She spoke loudly, her voice carrying over the sound of planes and gunfire. “These batpony vermin encroach on our sacred homelands, the pastures rightfully bestowed upon us by our Sun-Empress! They hide like cornered rats in their cave homes, plotting our demise.”\n\nMaple flinched as bullets pinged off the vehicles armour. His heart beat rapidly in his chest, but he clutched his weapon and found courage in the commissar’s words.\n\n“You will carry the burning wrath of Daybreaker into their warrens and smite all who lay within! This is what our goddess demands of you! For those of you who return victorious, know that you will be forever honoured as instruments of divine will! For those of you who perish to the enemy, know that you have carried our nation another step towards the shining future destined to us! For those of you who harbour doubt or cowardice, know that the only honour that awaits you is an unmarked grave!”\n\nAs the APC shuddered to a halt, Maple’s heart steadied and his worried frown disappeared. The commissar was right. He could not afford to show fear. Ponykind itself was counting on him. \n\n“Kill them all! This is our sacred duty! Kill them all! This is our motherland’s prayer! Kill them all! This is the will of our goddess! Do not waver! Do not falter! Death to the enemies of the sun!”\n\nThe soldiers roared their approval, storming out into the jungle.

 paxsolaris.87.d:0 "It was late. The moon hung high above the thick clouds and crickets chirped in the distance. The elderly pastor sat at the edge of his porch, flipping through an orange book with a look of disbelief on his face. In his youth, he’d been an archaeologist, spending decades of his career digging through the soil of the Tenochtitlan basin in an attempt to unravel the mysteries of the ancient Neighua tribe. Even after retiring and finding peace behind the alter of the Celestial Church, he remained an expert in the region’s cultural customs.\n\nYet he’d never expected to see them written down in a solar bible. Daybreaker had ordained a new religious doctrine for her churches, one that did little to hide its Neighuan influences. While he considered himself a devote follower of the sun, some of these rituals they wanted him to carry out were sickening. Animal sacrifices, regimented prayers, the branding of unbelievers. Rituals that seemed to have been drawn straight from the cruel Tenochtitlan cults of old, falling just short of sacrificing actual ponies. The pastor knew it wouldn’t be long before they crossed that line too.\n\nStranger still was the attention given to each ritual. Much about the Neighua was still unknown, but the authors of this bible seemed to know every minute detail that came with their religion. What knife to use for sacrifices, what prayers to speak and how long they should last. But that was impossible. Even the modern descendants of that sadistic cult had forgotten their own doctrine, yet the evidence was sitting in his hooves. All the atrocities of the Aztlan Empire were about to be repeated.\n\nThe paster placed the bible down, his hooves trembling slightly. He turned his gaze to the sun just peaking over the horizon, praying for answers."

 paxsolaris.91.d:0 "With the discovery of large untapped crystal deposits in the dragon lands comes a wave of immigration as ponies from all over Equestria travel across the seas to seek their fortune. This surge of pony migrants and workers has forced us to re-evaluate our administration of these states. Our policy has thus far been to simply maintain Imperial control over the region through an extensive network of military garrisons, but this method provides little in the way protection for our new settlements against dragon counterattacks. To address this problem, three options have been outlined.\n\nGiven the nature of dragons, long term coexistence between them and the ponies would require dragons to be at least somewhat compliant with solar rule. Thankfully, the dragons have little in the way of loyalty or national pride. By devoting some of the crystals produced by our mines towards feeding the dragons, we can secure enough loyalty to make them behave.\n\nAlternatively, we could make use of the numerous caves scattered across the region by turning them into work camps for the dragons. Their strength and endurance would boost our mining capabilities immensely, while the tight control we maintain over their movements would keep our settlers from falling under attack.\n\nFinally, there is the option supported by the more radical branches of our government. Dragons have been a nuisance for centuries, destroying pony villages and even preying upon our people. They believe it is time for ponykind to end this pest. Permanently."

She gazed out at the sunlit horizon, watching the swell of the ocean in silent contemplation. It was peaceful, a sharp contrast to the past few months. The mare glanced down at her hooves, idly wondering just how much blood had been split under her command. Dragons were resilient creatures, but even they could be slain. She just never expected the deaths to weigh so heavily on her conscious.\n\nFor the briefest moment, she found herself doubting Daybreaker. What could they possibly gain by bringing a sentient species to the brink of extinction? Sunset mercilessly squashed that thought. It wasn’t her place to question the Empress’ orders. The alicorn had offered her the second chance nobody else had, and Sunset refused to waste it.\n\nShe turned her gaze to the rising sun, soaking in its warmth to drive away those treasonous thoughts. When Daybreaker ruled the world, all the blood she had spilt, all the atrocities she had committed in the name of the solar alicorn would be washed away. Sunset just needed to persist forward and ignore the voices telling her to stop."

As if the harmonist protests weren’t enough, now it seemed even her own soldiers and officers were disobeying orders. She sighed to herself. No matter how many barriers she dealt with, the world somehow managed to throw another in her path.\n\nShe wished she could say this was a surprise, but Daybreaker had long realised that the world hated giving ponykind the safety and prosperity they deserved. It hated them just as much as Daybreaker hated it, but that didn’t worry the solar monarch. She would destroy this threat, just as she had done to so many others. The only question was how.\n\nIt was clear that these sympathisers were still loyal to the harmonist defectors, possibly even receiving orders from them. No doubt the defectors were passing information from their contacts in the military to resistance movements. Killing them all would be the most straightforward solution, but would enrage the moderates and vindicate the harmonist rabble. Authorising the termination of war heroes would not help her gain the support of the public.\n\nAlternatively, she could show lenience to the defectors. They would no doubt exploit her trust to use their considerable influence for spreading anti-solar sentiment, but it would leave the rabble rousers calling her a brutal tyrant with no leg to stand on. It may even result in a few of the defectors being willing to resume working with her administration. However, the traitors within her military would remain at large.\n\nDaybreaker shelved the booklet and stood up from behind her desk. It was time to raise the sun.

Renouncing his loyalties to the Equestrian Army had taken more courage than charging an enemy machinegun nest, but he couldn’t just do nothing. Daybreaker had taken the nation he loved so dearly and turned it upside-down. He had joined the army to fight for harmony, not this twisted mockery.\n\nSilver Gust had expected Daybreaker to have his head on a pike for treason, yet here he was, safe and sound. Wasn’t she supposed to be a ruthless tyrant like Nightmare Moon? If she was, why did he still draw breath? Looking out the window, he could see no signs of tyranny. There were no slavedrivers, no public executions, no pyres of flame.\n\nThat wasn’t to say nothing had changed. On the contrary, Daybreaker’s influence could still somehow be felt, even here. He could see it in the stallion who held his head just a bit higher and in the mother who didn’t worry about her kids as much. Everything just felt... safer.

Every spoilt noble, entitled wizard and lazy guard captain Equestria had to offer.

They shouted at each other across the room, all boasting of holding the secret to a quick and bloodless victory. It would be a miracle if even a tenth of these ponies had ever held a sword or gun in their lives.\n\nThis was the best Equestria had to offer. After centuries of peace, the Equestrian military had become little more than a social club for Canterlot’s nobility. Celestia watched in silence as Tall Bearer hurled obscenities at Idle Rich, claiming that he was unworthy of his position as General as if his responsibilities as Field Marshal amounted to anything more than drinking cocktails at galas. They were both no better than their fathers who had occupied those two seats before them. Celestia had stopped asking why the same family members appeared in her war room generation after generation a long time ago. Instead, she took pleasure in the few times actual talent somehow managed to worm its way up the ranks, but that was a rare occurrence these days.\n\nCelestia cursed herself for letting it come to this, for not acting sooner to stop this travesty from ever occurring. Maybe if she had asserted herself more, Equestria would be better prepared to handle the threat they now faced. At this point it would almost be easier to just burn it all and start anew. To scour the rot and let Harmony breath once again. Celestia squashed that thought almost as quickly as it came. She couldn’t do that to her little ponies, even if some might deserve it.\n\nThe meeting adjourned, having accomplished nothing but wasting hours of Celestia’s time.

My decision is final. Your factories will be temporarily seized and repurposed for the war effort. Ponykind needs fighters more than luxury airships. If you are truly so worried about your income, I hear the army has many employment opportunities.”\n\nNot that he needed to worry about money. Golf Leaf was making more bits profiteering than he ever made from airships.

Instead, you singled out the only one in your group not smart enough to know when to hold his tongue to be your spokesmare? Pathetic.” \n\n“Your Majesty! We have nothing but Equestria’s best interests at heart!”\n\nCelestia sneered. “Oh spare me your grovelling! If Canterlot fell tomorrow you would be kissing the ground [primary_enemy.GetLeader] walked on!”\n\n“That’s an unfair accusation your maje-”\n\n“Silence,” Celestia cut him off. She flared her wings and her mane ignited in a burst of fire. For the first time since he approached her, Tall Bearer felt true terror.\n\n“You ponies don’t care about Equestria. You never have. You just want to return to the old days where I would turn a blind eye to the slow decay of my nation for the sake of preserving stability because I once so foolishly decided to share power with selfish parasites. If you thought Equestria’s enemies would offer you a better deal, you’d have sold us all out a long time ago,” Celestia leaned forward until her nose was mere inches from Tall Bearer. “But now you are powerless, and when the enemies of Equestria are ash, I will make sure you stay that way. Now run along, my little ponies. There is much work to be done.”\n\nWhat little courage the group had vanished. They stood aside and Celestia pushed all thoughts of them out of her mind."

Neither sister had spoken a word to the other in weeks, but Luna couldn’t put this off any longer.\n\n“Sister, may I have a word with you?”\n\nCelestia turned, revealing the deep bags under her eyes. Faint tear stains still lingered on her face, but the worst thing about her sister was her eyes. The purple irises that once shone with so much kindness now burned with an all-consuming hatred.\n\n“What?” Celestia practically spat.\n\n“I am worried. You seem colder these days.”\n\nShe narrowed her eyes. “That tends to happen when one is forced to send ponies into a meatgrinder.”\n\n“The war has been hard on everyone, that I know. But sister, you are not who you used to be. You don’t greet me like you used to. Tall Bearer tells me you’ve been terrifying ponies into submission. You don’t even smile anymore!”\n\n“What do I have to smile about?” Celestia glared at her. “Ponies are dying, Luna. Nothing will make me smile until I have the head of [primary_enemy.GetLeader] on a spike.”\n\nLuna backed away slightly. “That’s exactly what I’m talking about! The Celestia I knew would never fantasise about such a thing!”\n\n“Then the Celestia you knew was weak.”\n\n“Look I know how hard it is to rule, especially in times like this, but some of the measures you have enacted hurt our ponies, not protect them.”\n\n“If I must hurt my ponies to save them, then so be it,” Celestia turned away. “Now leave me. I have to receive the news from the front.”\n\nShe tried to walk away, but Luna teleported in her path. “Please sister, just stop for a while to think about this! You are not yourself!”"

 paxsolaris.104.d:0 "It was late. The moon was making its final descent across the sky, casting silver light across the land. That light did not touch Celestia. Nothing could hope to compete with the warm orange glow that now surrounded the alicorn. She should be in bed by now, but Celestia found herself feeling as energetic as ever. For the first time in what felt like a century, she had time to relax. And what a beautiful night for it.\n\n“Um... your Majesty?” A quiet voice reached her ears. Celestia turned and spotted Tall Bearer standing at the doorway to the palace. He trembled as her gaze fell upon him.\n\n“What do you want that is so urgent you think it wise to interrupt me?” Celestia demanded.\n\nTall Bearer approached slowly, flinching as her fiery tail licked the ground beneath him. The rainbow hue had burned away a while ago, but Celestia decided she preferred this style. It suited her more.\n\n“It’s about the latest round of conscription...” Tall Bearer began.\n\n“Yes, I hear it was the most successful one yet,” Celestia levitated the teacup to her lips, a pleasant smile on her face. “Not a single report of desertion. Victory is in sight, my little pony.”\n\n“That’s the thing, your Majesty,” Tall Bearer averted his eyes. “With you leading us to victory, surely our war effort would not be hindered by one less soldier?”\n\nHer smile faded. “Get to the point.”\n\n“It’s my son. He’s been drafted into the service.”\n\nCelestia raised an eyebrow. “And?”"

When she was done, she placed the cup down and gave Tall Bearer her full attention.\n\n“How many sons and daughters have you sent to their deaths, my little pony? What makes your son more special than them? What reason do you have for me to make him the sole exception to my nation’s laws?”\n\n“Please, Princess. Take my son off the list, I beg of you. He’s all I have left. My family has served you for dutifully centuries! He’s just a colt, you cannot send him to his death!”\n\nThe alicorn pretended to consider his offer. “Hmmm... denied. Now get out of my sight.”\n\nTall Bearer spluttered. He stepped closer to the alicorn, his face beginning to resemble a ripe tomato. “I am a Field Marshal! You cannot do this to me!”\n\nThe stallion didn’t even have time to scream before flames engulfed him. In mere seconds they had vapourised everything. Flesh, bone and even magic was consumed in the inferno. When the glow faded, all that was left of Tall Bearer was a cooling pile of ashes.\n\n“Then consider yourself fired,” Celestia chuckled at her joke. She took another dainty sip of her teacup and looked out onto the city far below her."

It could not be seen, but Celestia knew it was there, lurking beneath the bed or in the corner of her eyes. It was there, for it had always been there.\n\n“Enough games! Show yourself, demon!” Celestia demanded.\n\nEmbers coiled around her hooves. They seem to revel in her confusion. “I think we both know why I can’t do that. You are terrified of what you will see.”\n\n“I don’t fear you!” Celestia shouted.\n\n“No, you fear yourself,” The flames leapt up the curtains, casting flickering orange images on the wall. Pain and destruction. Ponies bowing before a monster of fire. The sun devouring the world and leaving nothing in its wake. Celestia flinched away from the flaming curtains, snuffing them out with a quick spell.\n\n“You aren’t me!”\n\n“Oh but I am. You just wish I wasn’t. How desperately you wish I was something else. You’ve wished that ever since circumstance forced you to do what you should’ve done millennia ago. Ponies had grown weak and indolent under the freedom and luxury you provided whilst threats you should’ve dealt with were given time to fester. To continue on this path will only invite another war.”\n\n“What I did during the war may have been necessary,” Celestia admitted. “But that’s in the past. I’ve undone it all.”"

It may be a few years or a few centuries, but war will come again. You may lie to Equestria and promise another thousand years of peace, but you cannot lie to yourself. You know why you really need me.”\n\nThe apparition was right. It wasn’t Celestia’s fear of another war that kept it around. It was her fear of herself. There was no spirit. There never was. Just a mare afraid of her own fire.\n\n“Why won’t you leave me alone!?” Celestia pleaded with it.\n\n“You might as well ask your shadow the same question.”\n\nA long silence passed. Every flame in her chambers, from the flickering candles to the light of incandescent bulbs gathered at the edge of the room. Celestia knew what they were asking. They wanted permission. and she would give it.\n\n“Show me what you really are.”\n\nThey gathered into the crude form of a pony, growing larger as the flame morphed into flesh and bone until an alicorn stood before her. It was tall, fanged and clad in golden armour, but that face was her own. Celestia sent a bolt of magic at the apparition. It smiled as it crumbled into a million fragments of glass.\n\nCelestia breathed deeply and stared at the place her mirror once stood. The presence was gone, but the flame lingered at the back of her mind, waiting to be unleashed once more."

 paxsolaris.109.d:0 "Celestia blinked tears from her eyes as she looked down upon the city far beneath her. Equestria was burning. Every report Celestia read was worse than the last. Cities falling to Nightmare Moon’s onslaught, thestrals slaughtering innocent ponies, ambitious dissidents choosing this moment to defy her authority. It seemed like every day another state declared independence. Had she really been blind to these divides in her nation? Or was Nightmare Moon’s influence more widespread than Celestia thought?\n\nTwilight had left to gather the other element bearers, but Celestia doubted that trick would work a second time. She desperately wished that was not the case, but the cruelty of Nightmare Moon knew no bounds. With Twilight searching for her friends, Celestia was the only one left to lead her unprepared and collapsing nation.\n\nThat was probably for the best. This way, Twilight wouldn’t be around to see her idol and mentor weeping as she drafted a kill on sight order. Signing away millennia of peaceful traditions had felt like signing away her soul, but what else could Celestia do when the enemy dwelt within? To Tartarus with Luna, it was her army of brainwashed converts that gave the princess hesitation. Killing them weighed heavy on her heart, but there was no room for weakness now. Celestia knew what had to be done. This was not the first time Luna had forced Celestia into slaughtering her little ponies."

She knew it was wrong to be so rude to a hardworking pony, but every second this war continued more of her subjects died.\n\n“Certainly, your majesty,” Sweetie Drops bowed slightly. “It is as we feared. Most thestrals are at least compliant with Nightmare Moon’s regime, if not outright supportive. I have identified over a hundred spies operating in our command structure, many of them thestrals. It pains me to say this, but I don’t believe they can be trusted.”\n\nCelestia sighed. She had been afraid of that. The thestrals served nopony but Luna. Even after a thousand years of effort on Celestia’s part they still preferred to exist on the fringes of Equestrian civilisation. Luna’s return was supposed to heal this divide, not radicalise them into attacking ponykind.\n\nLetting the thestrals exist outside of her oversight had been foolish. Just another addition to the long list of mistakes Celestia now had to pay for. She would not be surprised to learn they had spent the last thousand years plotting Nightmare Moon’s return.\n\n“That is unacceptable,” Celestia spoke. “I loathe to do this, but I don’t see any other option. You now have express permission to detain and hold any suspected Nightmare sympathisers without trial.”\n\nSweetie Drops stared at the princess with a look of disbelief. “Without trial, your majesty? Does that not seem extreme?”\n\n“I do not take this decision lightly, my little pony. But to protect ponykind, sacrifices must be made. Just get it done.”\n\nA look of anger flashed on the agent’s face, but it was gone as quickly as it appeared. Sweetie Drops bowed to the princess."

To anypony else, the heat would be unbearable, but the flames welcomed the princess like an old friend.\n\nUnicorn mages kept pace either side, slowly advancing through the forest clad in silver flame-retardant suits. Only their horns were visible, hosing down the ruined homes with magefire. While Twilight was handling Celestia’s administrative duties, the princess had decided to expedite the efforts of her army by mopping up Lunar guerrillas so her armoured divisions could advance safely.\n\nA bullet zipped out of the treeline and ricocheted off the alicorn’s flesh. Celestia’s eyes snapped towards the source. A split second later the trees were blasted into splinters by a beam of crimson magic. The rebels didn’t even have time to scream. Celestia advanced onwards, flinging aside fallen trees and charred bodies in her path. Fire now danced at the end of her mane and tail, licking the blood-soaked ground with a primal hunger.\n\nHer advance was halted when she reached the rocky face of a hill. She spotted a small cave entrance was hidden behind a covering of moss. Celestia burnt away the moss, revealing the black void within.\n\n“This is the entrance to a thestral town,” One of the unicorns explained, his voice muffled by a heavy gas mask. “They’ll be dug in like ticks and won’t give up their homes without a fight, but we can’t launch our offensive without securing these hills. What should we do, your majesty?”\n\nAs Celestia studied the cave entrance, she felt a cold and familiar presence surround her. The princess smiled. Nightmare Moon had come to witness her destroyer.\n\n“If they love their caves so much, let them stay,” Celestia looked to her stunned subordinate. “Forever”\n\nHer magic lashed out, tearing into the cave ceiling and pulling matter from the walls. The earth trembled as the cave collapsed, trapping thousands of thestrals beneath the earth to live out their last hours in darkness. Celestia could not think of a more fitting fate. The cold presence surrounding her recoiled as if physically wounded. Celestia raised an eyebrow. Horror. She did not think Nightmare Moon was capable of feeling such things. Serves her right. She had taken the lives of Celestia’s subjects, it was about time the solar alicorn returned the favour. Soon there would be nothing standing between her and the moon princess."

The tribe has a long history, being the primary architects of the mighty Aztlan Empire which even today is regarded as one of the great pre-unification pony civilisations both for its scientific achievements and unquestionable military might. Local legend claims that throughout their rule the Neighua stained the pyramid of Tonaltzintli with the blood of a million ponies in worship of Chalchiuhtl, many of them thestrals. This practice was only abandoned when the alicorn sisters came to integrate the region into the newly formed Equestria.\n\nThough the Neighua were reluctant to forsake their ancient ways, they yielded to Celestia after she demonstrated her control over the sun. She was declared an avatar of Chalchiuhtl and given the undying support of some of the most fanatical and bloodthirsty warriors the world has ever known. Now that Daybreaker has ascended, many of the Tenochtitlan priests are claiming that she is Chalchiuhtl herself, come to lead her faithful to glory.

Even after all that she had done, all that she had sacrificed, victory was outside her grasp. Her ponies still suffered under the yoke of foreign occupation. Perhaps it was time for her to address this problem personally?\n\nHer magic flared to life, summoning a set of golden armour that seemed to shimmer like an aurora. Laying eyes on it filled Daybreaker with a strange sense of nostalgia. How many would-be tyrants had she killed wearing this armour? How many kingdoms had been broken beneath her? This list was far longer than Celestia would admit and far shorter than Daybreaker wanted it to be.\n\nAs sure as the sun rose in the sky, Daybreaker would make sure [sol_defeated.GetNameDef] was added to that list. They had made the mistake of bringing war to Equestria, foolishly believing they could challenge destruction incarnate. For that mistake, Daybreaker vowed to bring ruin down upon them the likes of which their mortal minds could not comprehend."

As she returned to Canterlot, many subjects both old and new rushed out to wave hello to their beloved monarch. While none can deny that Empress Daybreaker had proven herself worthy of the ancient legends ascribed to her, the solar high command has expressed relief that the alicorn agreed to return now that the enemy has been driven from Equestria. She has wasted no time in resuming her role as empress of the nation."

 paxsolaris.138.d:0 "Another day, another strike. Since she had begun her efforts to modernise Equestria’s infrastructure, progress had been halted numerous times by labour shortages. It seemed that no matter what Daybreaker did for her ponies, something always managed to get in her way.\n\nOnce again, the solar empress was left feeling conflicted. She loathed unnecessary luxury, viewing it as a waste of limited resources that could be better spent elsewhere, but her ponies wanted more than just the bare minimum. The only question was whether Equestria could afford it. For the betterment of everyone, these projects needed to be completed. Any delays to address the concerns of the workers would only disadvantage her nation in the long run.\n\nYet the builders were not solely to blame for these delays. For lack of a better option, Daybreaker had instructed her businesspony supporters to manage Equestria’s development. Many of them only supported her to enrich themselves and saw their fellow ponies as tools to be exploited. Of course they denied it, but Daybreaker could read them like an open book. The twitches, the subtle facial cues, it was all so obvious once you took the time to look. They cared not for Equestria or Daybreaker’s children and they never would.\n\nWere they not so important, Daybreaker would punish them severely for their treachery. Unfortunately, they were needed to keep the economy alive and her ponies employed. Forcing the factory owners to cave into the unionist’s demands would only alienate them and add unnecessary costs, but letting them continue to treat her ponies like a commodity was just as unacceptable. She would not make the same mistakes that led up to the creation of Stalliongrad and ignore the obvious signs of worker mistreatment."

 paxsolaris.139.d:0 "Red Hammer shivered as the alicorn’s gaze fell upon him, then silently cursed himself for showing fear. This was not his first negotiation. Like the other union leaders in the throne room, he’d been chosen to represent the workers of Equestria many times before, facing down everything from oil tycoons to mob bosses, but this his first time negotiating with a creature that could reduce a pony to cinders with but a thought.\n\n“Thank you all for accepting my invitation,” Daybreaker spoke to the dozen union leaders from behind her wall of fire. “I understand that you may feel nervous about being called before me, but rest assured, my only desire is to better the lives of my little ponies.”\n\nHer calming words helped soothe their nerves. Taking the initiative, Red Hammer stood up from his half bow, facing the shadowed form of the alicorn. “If that is really your goal, then surely you will help us? The bourgeoise treat us like tools. All we want is fair compensation for our labour.”\n\n“Understand that my position forces me to look at the big picture when it comes to the governing of my nation. I emphasise with your cause, but a strong economy is essential for Equestria’s security. We cannot afford delays.”\n\n“But you can afford a throne made of gold?” Red Hammer shot back, immediately paling once he remembered who he was speaking to. The earth pony trembled in fear, waiting for the beam of plasma that would snuff him from existence. But it never came. Instead, a strange noise filled the room."

 paxsolaris.140.d:0 "The wall of fire disappeared, allowing them to see Daybreaker for the first time. The mare sat on a thin red cushion, surrounded by stacks of papers and a few dirty plates. Her skin was an unblemished white and her eyes shone with the wrath of the sun, but there was something mundane about the way she held herself. Something that told him the empress was no stranger to the endless grind of existence. A smile grew on Daybreaker’s face as if she could read his mind.\n\n“Believe me, this throne is not for my benefit,” She explained. “Fate has surrounded me with greedy, untrustworthy parasites who would defy me at every turn if I showed even a hint of weakness.”\n\nRed Hammer tensed as a flash of anger passed across the alicorn’s face. No, anger wasn’t the right word. This was something far deeper; a simmering hatred that burned like a primordial force of nature. It was gone as quickly as it came, replaced by a disarming smile.\n\n“Surely you ponies would be the first to understand that the industrialists and nobles respect nothing but wealth and power? To keep them in line, certain sacrifices must be made. This throne is uncomfortable and impractical, but it keeps my cabinet too intimidated to consider treason.”\n\nAn odd emotion welled up inside Red Hammer. Sympathy. He glanced over to Brick Hooves and found her with an identical expression on her face. The alicorn had no idea how right she was. Power and wealth were everything to the ponies Red Hammer negotiated with. It took a shrewd pony to exploit those values.\n\n“But enough about me,” Daybreaker interrupted his thoughts. She ignited her horn, causing a thin booklet to appear before each of the union leaders."

 paxsolaris.141.d:0 "“Thank you for your time, Empress Daybreaker,” Red Hammer bowed to the alicorn, soon joined by the other union leaders.\n\nThat had been one of the shortest negotiations of his career. The empress hadn’t wasted any time trying to frustrate him with pointless loopholes or amateur intimidation tactics. Rather, he got the impression that she genuinely wanted to reach an acceptable agreement as soon as possible. That wasn’t to say she’d accepted all their demands, but Red Hammer believed he’d scored a great victory for the proletariat today.\n\nDaybreaker hadn’t agreed to a minimum wage as he’d hoped, but she’d given them something far more valuable; protection and guaranteed employment under her public works programs. Employers could no longer fire their workers for forming trade unions nor could they replace them with other workers. If he was being honest, Daybreaker had been their saving grace. It would have been so easy for the alicorn to find ponies desperate enough to cross the picket line, but instead she’d sought the unionists out and given them the tools necessary to fight for their rights.\n\nRed Hammer took a moment to consider how much his opinion of his empress had changed in the span of a few hours. She wasn’t the lynchpin of the bourgeoise, but an overworked leader that genuinely wanted to help ponykind. That thought went against every bit of his intuition, but he couldn’t see Daybreaker as anything else now that he’d met her.\n\nAs he stepped out into the sunlight, Red Hammer felt a hoof tap his shoulder. He turned and saw Brick Hooves giving him a concerned look.\n\n“What’s on your mind?” She asked.\n\nRed Hammer glanced back at the Imperial Palace, still trying to process what he’d just been through."

It had been so long since she’d taken a moment to appreciate the simple beauty of existence. She’d almost forgotten there was more to life than a desperate struggle for survival.\n\n“My loyal subjects!” She began, projecting her voice across the crowd of ponies beneath her. “I come before you seeking to rectify an ancient flaw in our nation. Despite all our strength, despite all that we have accomplished, there are still ponies who live without the base necessities they deserve as children of the sun! This shameful travesty cannot continue. Is generosity not one of the six virtues of harmony, the founding principles of our empire?”\n\nThere were those in her cabinet who had opposed these measures. They rebelled at the idea of increasing taxes on the rich to fund programs to support the vulnerable ponies of Equestria. Daybreaker was aware these costs would burden the solar economy, but the poor couldn’t wait around for her enemies to die. They needed help, and it was her duty to provide. The deafening cheers of the crowd told Daybreaker she’d made the right choice.\n\n“That is why I have created a new initiative, to provide every pony under my light with a basic standing of living. Our enemies have tasted my wrath, but you, the loyal and hardworking ponies of Equestria, will always have my kindness. I promise to heal your wounds and sate your hunger.”"

They were deathly silent, keeping their eyes trained on the alicorn. None of them even had the courage to pick at their food.\n\n“I trust you understand the purpose of this meeting,” Daybreaker spoke at last, turning back to face the group. “You each occupy an important role in society, and I believe we all stand to benefit through increased cooperation.”\n\n“What did you have in mind?” One pony managed to find the confidence to speak up.\n\n“Ah, Heavy Flywheel. You have made quite the name for yourself in the automobile industry,” The alicorn began, watching as the brown earth pony tensed under her gaze. “I am in need of a fleet of trucks to assist in the construction of new infrastructure, trucks which I am happy to purchase from your company should you be willing to negotiate a deal.”\n\nDaybreaker watched as the pony took a moment to weigh up her offer. She would require thousands of trucks for these projects, and Flywheel knew it. Even if he sold them below retail value, he still stood to make an enormous profit. Any sensible businesspony would take her offer.\n\n“While your offer is sound, I can’t meet your demands,” Flywheel replied. “My factories have been short on staff ever since these strikes broke out.”\n\n“Lazy peasants...” One of the nobles muttered.\n\nThe rain on the windows began to boil away as Daybreaker clenched her teeth. How she wished to reduce that pony to ash, but she needed his funding to expedite her efforts to develop Equestria’s infrastructure. So the alicorn forced a smile on her face, letting the noble remain oblivious to how close she’d come to killing him.\n\n“Rest assured, your workers will return to their posts,” Daybreaker promised. She took no pleasure in using her power to break up strikes, but with her nation besieged, any delays were unacceptable."

He landed hard on the concrete, his head spinning from the impact.\n\nA handful of unicorns stood on the other side of the barrier, using their magic to erect a shield around the factories. The unionists watched in frustration as smoke began to billow from the chimneys. Red Hammer glared at the rows of ponies waiting to begin the next shift as Brick Hooves helped him to his feet.\n\n“Calm down, Red. There isn’t anything we can do,” She consoled.\n\n“Like Tartarus there is!” He spat, turning to the crowd and gesturing to the line of police officers. “Come on! Are we going to let these bootlickers treat us like tools?”\n\n“Damnit Red! Don’t encourage them!” Brick Hooves pulled his foreleg down. “It’s not worth the risk.”\n\nRed Hammer shook himself out of her grip, but he knew she was right. If he provoked the crowd into attacking, they’d be hurt. They had families to support, families that would go hungry if this strike continued for much longer. The bourgeoise could keep bringing in desperate ponies from across the country under the solar tyrant’s protection for as long as they pleased, but the workers only had a week before they’d begin to starve.

Tomorrow morning, the Inquisition would begin the largest crackdown on resistance activity since the organisation’s inception, striking targets all across Equestria. The Harmony Restoration Movement had been a thorn in her side for far too long. With them out of the way, there would be nothing to stop her from beginning the next phase of her plans.\n\nBut it was never that simple. After this next phase of operations, the Inquisition would be left with thousands of captured partisans. Their fate would be hers to decide, but what to do with them?\n\nExecution would be the easiest option. They could not obstruct her efforts to better ponykind from the grave. It would certainly be the most deserving fate for trying to deny her beloved ponies the safety they were entitled to. That said, Daybreaker did not want the next chapter of ponykind’s history to begin with the brutal massacre of Equestrian citizens. Sparing these traitors from the fate they deserved was the perfect opportunity to remind her loyal subjects that she was still a merciful ruler at heart.\n\nYet no solution was flawless. So long as the partisans drew breath, they were a potential threat. Letting them toil away in labour camps would only suppress the Harmony Restoration Movement, not destroy it entirely. She’d be leaving heroes for future generations to rally around.\n\nThe solar alicorn sighed and stood up from her throne. Neither option was perfect, but Daybreaker was well acquainted with making tough decisions."

She turned her gaze towards a burly pegasus stallion and inclined her head. “Minister Rivet, I assume you have secured the necessary construction materials?”\n\nRivet flinched at her words, instantly lowering his eyes to his hooves. “O-Of course your majesty!”\n\nDaybreaker observed the pegasus closely, from the beads of sweat on his forehead to the slight tremble in his hooves. Rivet was no coward by any means. He’d stared down changeling guns during the Invasion of Canterlot and taken half a dozen of Chrysalis’ finest to their graves. Yet he was terrified of her, ponykind’s eternal protector. They all were.\n\nThe thought didn’t sit well with Daybreaker. She wanted to be loved, not feared. When she ascended, she’d vowed to create a world where ponykind would have nothing left to fear. Yet her actions had only made them fear her just as much as they’d feared monsters like Tirek or Chrysalis. Traitors may deserve punishment for compromising the safety of their fellow ponies, but the loyal had nothing to fear from her. So why were they scared?\n\nThe answer was obvious. If she wanted, she could reduce everything in this room to ashes before they could blink. There was nothing stopping her but her own hesitation. To soothe the fears of her little ponies, Daybreaker would need to give them a written guarantee of their own safety, some proof that her rule was not without limit. A constitution, as the griffons put it. Yet the thought of submitting herself to something as flimsy as a piece of paper repulsed to the alicorn. Was it really worth it just to settle the fears of a few ponies?"

I want to speak to all of you from the depths of my heart to the depths of yours. In the long history of our nation, few generations have shouldered the responsibility of fighting for the survival of ponykind. We face a challenge not seen since the dark days of the windigoes, but I have faith that the stallions and mares of Equestria will not accept annihilation without fighting to our last breath! I know that the energy, faith and devotion of this generation will light a torch that will shine brightly for another thousand years!”\n\n“It is not our magic or numbers that makes our nation great, but the fervour and defiant courage of every single pony, united through friendship and the guidance of my light. Our enemies fear this power, they fear the day when ponykind will see through their fake smiles and hollow promises as I have. Let them know that day has come! The day when we finally make this spiteful world good and pure for our children and our children’s children!”\n\n“For my beloved ponies, I offer you everything. My blood, my magic, my undying devotion. I pledge them all in service to our nation for as long as the sun shines upon these fields.

While much of the former kingdom has been placed under the rule of Solar Mandates, Empress Daybreaker has carved off a sliver of border territory to be annexed directly into Equestria for our growing population to expand into. The only question is what to do with the current inhabitants. Ponykind now has the chance to avenge the lives lost in this war, to make the changelings pay in blood for their crimes. We can make these frontier states the first to be wiped clean of the changeling taint. Others propose a more moderate option of resettling the changelings further north. They argue against chasing vengeance, that our nation would be better served by exploiting changeling industry and labour to fuel our war machine for the eventual conquest of Griffonia.\n\nDaybreaker herself has tentatively considered the merits of a third option. The changelings may have caused her beloved children much pain, but their natural talents are nonetheless useful. Taking advantage of the lack of unity amongst the hives to turn these frontier states into loyal assets of [EQS.GetNameDef] would greatly benefit ponykind. Changelings respect strength first and foremost, and Daybreaker has proven herself stronger than every hive queen put together. Domestic collaborators would be of great use in keeping the other changelings in line, the only question is whether raising them would be worth the effort."

Before the alicorn could react, Chrysalis’ wings disappeared, freeing her from Daybreaker’s hold. She leapt forward, driving her sharpened horn into the neck of her foe. Hot blood spilled from the wound, splattering across the pulverised concrete.\n\n“I should’ve just done that back at that wedding,” Chrysalis laughed as more of the alicorn’s blood trickled down her horn. She glanced up and felt her heart skip a beat.\n\nDaybreaker was staring down at her, smiling despite the jagged horn still buried in her neck. Chrysalis tried to back away, but a crimson aura held her in place. The alicorn let her hammer fizzle away into golden sparks before raising her hoof. She brought it down at the base of the changeling’s horn, snapping it clean off.\n\nChrysalis screamed in agony, stumbling away as her own green blood leaked from the spot her horn used to be. Daybreaker tossed the severed appendage across the bunker and approached the changeling slowly, savouring her fear.\n\n“I forgot how crafty you bugs are. If it’s any consolation, I would’ve been due for a long reforming process if you did that back at the wedding. Unfortunately, I’ve gotten a lot stronger since we last fought.”\n\nCrimson magic pulled the changeling into Daybreaker’s hooves. She lifted Chrysalis up against the ceiling and tensed her hindlegs."

They exploded out of the ground, shattering every window in the neighbourhood. Daybreaker shot upwards at breakneck speeds, splitting the sky with a deafening sonic boom. The echo of her attack rang out across the mountains before fading away until only the pained breathing of the changeling could be heard.\n\nDaybreaker held Chrysalis out before her, letting see the flames consuming her city. “Take a good look, insect. This is what happens to monsters in my world.”\n\nThe changeling capital was all but obliterated. Entire neighbourhoods had been reduced to rubble with ravenous tongues of fire picking at what remained. A single tear trailed down the queen’s cheek. Decades of careful planning and all Chrysalis had to show for it was a mountain of corpses.\n\n“Do you have any idea how old I am?” Daybreaker spun her foe around to face her, revelling in her despair. “I saw the All-Mother form this planet out of cosmic dust and will live to see it be burnt to a cinder. Out of the things this pitiful ball of dirt and moss has spat out, there is but one worthy of note. One species that could make two goddesses abandon their power just to walk among them.”\n\nShe pulled the changeling closer until their noses were almost touching, letting her see the hateful nuclear fire swirling in the alicorn’s crimson eyes. “I would sooner tear this world to atoms than let malformed stardust slaughter the only thing on this fragile rock that matters to me!”\n\nBlood escaped the changeling’s mouth as she began to chuckle. Daybreaker raised an eyebrow, struggling to understand why Chrysalis found her words amusing."

 paxsolaris.156.d:0 "“And now that I do, I realise you’re more pathetic than I thought. You only love ponies because they make you feel needed. Had you chosen any other species to be the patron of, they would have outgrown you centuries ago. The only thing special about ponies is their perpetual weakness.”\n\nA dark look passed across the alicorns face, but Chrysalis could tell her words had struck a nerve.\n\n“You claim to be the mother of ponykind, but a mother would want their children to grow up. No, you’re just a sad, old mare with too much power trying to find something to give your eternity purpose. You want to play hero to the only species that needs one.”\n\nDaybreaker snarled and flung the changeling at the ground. The alicorn drew magic to her horn, filling the sky with a baleful red light before sending a beam of plasma at Chrysalis’ shrinking form. Her tough carapace was vapourised in an instant before the beam continued onwards, flattening an entire neighbourhood of the changeling capital.\n\nRage flowed through the alicorn like lava. She doubled the intensity of the beam, causing more homes to be blasted away into molten rubble. The fires consuming the city doubled in intensity as they fed on her anger. Daybreaker watched it all with a hateful glare. It was all too easy to make these ants suffer for their leader’s words.\n\nChrysalis was a liar, just like the rest of her kind. Daybreaker’s love for ponykind was true and pure. They cared for her and she cared for them in turn. What would a tyrant like Chrysalis know of that? She was an inferior lifeform, unable to comprehend the beauty of Daybreaker’s children.\n\nWith that thought, every flame in Vesalipolis was snuffed out. Daybreaker quietly surveying the damage of her rampage. Entire city blocks had been reduced to rubble while others had been burnt to a cinder. At the centre of the city, the Queen’s Tower sagged to the side, threatening to collapse at any moment. She desperately wanted to wipe this city off the map, but reason stayed her hoof."

She only handled the administrative duties of her small hive, keeping to the strict guidelines imposed by Queen Argynnis. Chrysalis probably wasn’t even aware of her existence, but that meant nothing to her new overlords. The moment they realised Orapia didn’t know anything useful, she would be executed like the others.\n\nThe door swung open and Orapia glanced up, expecting to see the grizzled earth pony interrogator. Instead, she found herself under the gaze of a pink-haired unicorn mare.\n\n“I’m told you are the former hive-queen of Coltiningrad?” The unicorn spoke, wasting no time on pleasantries.\n\nOrapia bristled at the name. Coltiningrad is what the ponies had taken to calling her hive, all part of their effort to erase any surviving vestiges of changeling identity. Her pride demanded she speak out, but fear held her tongue. If the ponies had laid waste to Vesalipolis, they could annihilate Volistad.\n\n“Yes, I am,” She managed to say.\n\n“I have come to deliver an offer from Empress Daybreaker. She has demanded that you tell your loyalists in this city to comply with the solar garrison. In exchange, you will keep your life and continue serving an administrative role alongside the solar governor.”\n\n“And if I refuse?”\n\n“Then you will be destroyed, along with any changeling who opposes us. Consider your options carefully, Orapia. Empress Daybreaker is willing to forgive your past transgressions against ponykind and offer your hive a privileged position in her empire. All you have to do is comply with her laws.”\n\nOrapia hung her head, already knowing what her answer would be. Daybreaker could have Volistad flattened with but a word if the thought crossed her mind. Even if her subjects survived, how long would it be before the hive’s meagre love reserves ran out? Orapia might have been powerless under Chrysalis, but now she had the chance to give her subjects a future in this bleak world."

He hadn’t spoken to this pony in years and had no reason to believe the stallion was as open-minded as he’d been before everything had gone to Tartarus. This could be a trap, but Marsilio had questions only the pony inside could answer. With that thought, the changeling stepped inside and spotted his target: a blue stallion with a white mane in a booth in the corner of the bar. The pony subtly beckoned him over, keeping his gaze on the soldiers patrolling outside.\n\n“Spectrograph, it’s been too long,” Marsilio took a seat opposite the pony, extending a hoof.\n\n“Likewise,” The stallion replied, accepting the offered hoof with a smile before remembering himself. He tilted his head towards the open window. “Try to keep your voice down. I’m not supposed to be here.”\n\n“Right, right. So, what is it you needed me for?”\n\nSpectrograph pulled a thin booklet of papers from his bag and slid them across the table. “It’s a project the Empress has me working on. I think you’ll find it interesting.”\n\nMarsilio looked between the papers and his friend for a few moments before he flipped open the first page and set to work. Several minutes of silence passed as he read through the outline, his eyes widening with each passing paragraph.\n\n“Don’t get your hopes up,” Spectrograph interrupted, seeing the look on his friend’s face. “We’ve only been given funding for a trial run on prisoners, but if all goes well this project could create a steady love source for collaborators and their families.”\n\nMarsilio nodded and handed the booklet back to the pony. “It’s interesting, but I won’t work with you. I swore I’d take no part in helping your Empress.”\n\n“Look, Marsilio. I’m only on this project because of the papers we published together and we both know you were the brains behind that. If this project fails the trial run, that’s it. Daybreaker will cut our funding and a lot of changelings are going to starve. Please, I need your help.”\n\nThe changeling paused for a moment.

He’d watched from this spot as giant machines swept away the bombed-out rubble before teams of pony workers arrived to build a house in its place. These new ponies were different. This time there was a small pony, barely visible behind the hooves of the two larger ones. Carapace didn’t know ponies came in different sizes.\n\nThe nymph thought for a moment. Changelings came in different sizes. He was a lot smaller than mommy, but bigger than the hatchlings. The small pony must be a nymph too! That meant it was his job to welcome the small pony, maybe then he’d make a friend who wouldn’t tease him like his older brother!\n\nHe pushed open the door, slowly making his way to the two large ponies who were unloading things from their truck. The small pony had gotten bored and started wandering down the sidewalk, meaning that Carapace could introduce himself properly. He wished he was old enough to shapeshift like mommy, then he could look way cooler for his new friend!\n\n“Hi there!” Carapace spoke up, causing the small pony to jump slightly. The changeling offered his hoof like he’d seen the older ponies do. “My name is Carapace! Are you a nymph too?”\n\nThe pony stumbled back slightly, his eyes darting between the offered hoof and the changeling’s face. Slowly he brought his hoof up to tap the changeling’s.\n\n“H-Hi. My name is Honeycrisp,” The pony stammered. “What’s a nymph?”\n\n“It’s what the grownups call little changelings,” Carapace tilted his head. “Do ponies not have those?”\n\nHoneycrisp shook his head. “We have colts and fillies, but I’ve never heard of pony nymphs.”\n\n“Well, you seem nice. Do you want to be friends? I can show you this spot on the river where there’s a huge rock wall you can jump off!”\n\nThe pony smiled."

 paxsolaris.160.d:0 "Ochetellus sat underneath the shade of an old oak tree, levitating a flask to his mouth. This had become a routine for the changeling, one that he’d picked up soon after the ponies had stormed through his homeland. It wasn’t the most comfortable place to drown out his sorrows, but the peaceful sounds of nature were the only thing keeping Ochetellus from drinking himself into oblivion. If there was one thing the ponies had done right, it was adding greenery to break up the greyscale of changeling architecture.\n\nThis was the fate of many veterans of the Great War. When Vesalipolis fell, they were left without purpose. Some returned to their families, others kept up the fight as members of the Changeling Liberation Front. It was those changelings Ochetellus felt the most sorry for. The ponies would never stop. Sooner or later, his former comrades would taste the bitterness of defeat once more, and for what? Daybreaker was cruel, but she promised them a future under her new order. It wasn’t much, but it gave the old veteran hope for tomorrow.\n\nA shout brough the changeling out of his thoughts. He watched as a colt ran across the grass, a young changeling hot on his tail. The changeling was Chrysanthe’s nymph, though he couldn’t recall a name. He seemed to be playing a game with the pony, a game Ochetellus couldn’t follow in his drunken stupor. What he did notice were the bright smiles on their faces. They were happy. Despite everything, despite all the bloodshed and the hatred, they’d both found something nice in this bleak world. It would seem the pony empress intended on keeping her promise. Ochetellus glanced over to his flask before throwing it away.\n\nPerhaps it was time to think about the future instead of wallowing in the past. He might not like the ponies, but that didn’t mean he needed to spend the rest of his life waiting to die. The ponies were offering positions in their army for changeling volunteers. The flag might be different, but if Daybreaker was right, there was still something for him to fight for."

That was something he’d rarely see in Appleloosa, not if he didn’t want Ma or Pa to get mad at him for wasting water. The colt’s heart ached for his hometown. Ma said he should be thankful for what they had, that they’d never have to worry about food again, but Honeycrisp felt homesick all the same. There was nopony to talk to in Frostdale.\n\nThe sound of running water caught his attention. The pony followed the noise and found himself standing on the edge of a large rock wall, glancing down at a deep stream only a few metres below him. It looked like it might be a good swimming spot, had there been anypony to enjoy it with.\n\nHe turned around to retrace his steps, but his hoof hit something soft. Curious, the colt bent over and found a small schoolbag lodged under a rock. Shaking off the dirt, Honeycrisp unzipped it with his teeth and peered inside. He hoped they’d be a way to tell who owned the beg so he could return it, but all he found inside was a hoof-drawn picture of a black pony. No, not a pony. A changeling. The artwork was sloppy, but the green insectoid wings were unmistakable. There was an adult changeling, with a comically large smile on her face surrounded by a group of smaller changelings. A name was written near the bottom. Carapace.\n\nHoneycrisp scrunched the paper into a ball and dropped it in the stream where it was soon joined by the rest of the bag. Changelings were not to be trusted, that’s what Pa said. They were dangerous parasites that want nothing more than to suck every last drop of love from him until he was nothing but a husk. The colt galloped away from the stream, trying to put as much distance between him and the changeling trap as possible."

We might have a traitor in our midst even now.” Puck finished, immediately staring around the room for even the slightest hint of betrayal in any of them.\n\nUtter silence. Nothing at all escaped their terrified mouths. This was bad. They weren’t prepared to be infiltrated by their own kind. Techniques for countering such a thing had been forgotten when the hive unified. Those damn ponies were crafty; more so than any of them had anticipated.\n\nThe changelings started searching the room for anyone they could blame, but none of them even knew where to start. The tension in the air palpable, as though they were all waiting for an excuse to kill each other in the hopes of rooting out a traitor that might not even exist. Puck could see that they were agitated and knew he had to say something before things went south.\n\n“Now now, just because things haven’t been going well for our cell lately doesn’t mean that we’re compromised. I’ve already set about arranging loyalty tests for everyling so that any possible infiltrators are rooted out as quickly as possible.”\n\n“And what about you Puck? You’re the one that keeps getting us into these messes! Why should we be so sure about you as our leader, huh?!” Another changeling called out from across the room.\n\nAlmost immediately someling else countered, accusing the bug that had stood up of intentionally sowing disloyalty. That was the final straw. All the pent-up frustration and paranoia broke free and everyling began shouting at one another, hurling accusations across the room. Soon enough the previously cohesive cell had descended into a full-on brawl, leaving no bug unscathed."

Oh and one of Ms. Purity’s friends from the army came in to show off his uniform and teach about the Imperial Army and show us how to march while carrying a rifle! What else… Uhm… Oh we did some reading as well, lots of different books and even some really old stuff from the Aztlan jungles!” He quickly explained, his face beaming with pride. “It was just like in Daring Do!”\n\n“Aw, that’s wonderful dearie!” Cotton Ball replied, running her hoof through the colt’s mane and nodding to the other mare. “Thanks ever so much for looking after him today, Purity. I wouldn’t know what to do with my evenings if I had this little ball of energy galloping about. How often do you run these sessions?”\n\n“Twice a week, every week. Though if the rumours of the Lightbringers being made mandatory next month are true, that could increase to three times a week.

Ponies needed their mother.\n\nThis war had the potential to be the bloodiest in Equestrian history, but Daybreaker was prepared to win it at all costs. The death of any of her ponies was a tragedy, but so long as ponykind endured any sacrifice would be worth it.\n\nThe alicorn cast her gaze east, her eyes burning with fury. Somewhere out there, the agents of ruin were plotting her downfall. They had gathered their forces to challenge her in open combat on the fields of Equestria, foolishly attempting to steal away the children of the sun. She would make them pay dearly for that.

From her perch in the towers of Canterlot, Daybreaker could feel the great leviathan stirring beneath her, awakened from its millennia-long slumber.\n\nA strange feeling of dread overtook Daybreaker as she realised that she could no longer stop this awakening. Equestria’s path was laid out before it, and ponykind would follow with or without her. The thought should have been exhilarating, but the alicorn could only feel sadness. Why? Was this not the culmination of years of struggle and sacrifice? Perhaps on some level, the knowledge that she could’ve undone everything brought her some measure of comfort. Her heart still ached for the old Equestria, however flawed it may have been. Had she done the right thing by leading her ponies down this path? What if there had been another way and she was just too grief-stricken to see it?\n\nIt was too late to ponder such things. She made her choice long ago, and now there was no going back. The Equestria she once knew was gone, replaced by a titan that would grow and grow until it bent the world to its will.

It wasn’t as though there had been any attacks here, so close to Canterlot.\n\n“…Martial law is now in effect, for the safety of all ponies under the protection of her majesty. Rations, curfews and checkpoints will likewise be instated within the next three days to…”\n\nBut… why? Everything had been so peaceful here, what was happening? Maybe he could ask some of the soldiers later, but they all looked so… aggressive? No, that wasn’t quite it. He couldn’t tell, but something was off about them. Was it another war? It couldn’t be, surely not so soon?\n\nThe stallion took a few steps back from the open air and stood stock still in their apartment for a moment, before he gestured for his son to follow him back inside.\n\n“Daddy, is it going to be like the times you told me about? With less food and the police with helmets?” His colt asked softly, nuzzling against his father’s fur.\n\nThe truth was, it wouldn’t be like the other times; it was already different. The home guard had never needed guns before, let alone armoured trucks and planes."

 paxsolaris.172.t:0 "Salted Grounds"
 paxsolaris.172.d:0 "“You missed a bit!” His commanding officer bellowed over the radio, gesturing over at a smouldering field which still had some crops left growing in it.\n\nThey’d spent the whole day marching through the field, burning whatever they could find and demolishing anything that could be of use to the resistance. That was the regiment’s job, tearing everything down so that whoever came to claim the rubble gained nothing but dust. Tank production had even been diverted somewhat to provide them with modified flamethrower and anti-concrete vehicles to speed up the process. Division 451 didn’t fight for ponykind, they torched whatever had been abandoned and moved on to the next sorry village, town or city that had been evacuated.\n\nBerry Fields breathed heavily through his thick rubber mask and sprayed the diesel across the field before igniting it and watching as the fire rose to the sky. She tried to see the beauty in the cleansing flames, but all she saw was a lush field that would be barren for decades to come.\n\n“Next field private, we only have an hour more at most here.” Blasted the corporal’s orders through the crackling radio installed in their protective gear.\n\nIf she hadn’t been doing this for a week already the smell of fuel and sulphur would have been unbearable, but it hadn’t taken long to adjust. She jumped up on the side of one of their fuel trucks and drove to the next patch of land that needed to be reduced to ash and dust. Another field, another minute of watching the plants curl up and die. Another old farmhouse that buckled and collapsed as the wood sizzled and broke. Another unit of enemy soldiers starving to death as they tried to advance. Another job well done."

 paxsolaris.173.d:0 "“Keep running, for fuck’s sake keep running!” The unicorn screamed to Black Hoof and Amber Wing.\n\nHe didn’t know if it would matter that he was going to stop and fight, he didn’t know if it was going to help, but anything was better than nothing. He turned and planted his tired hooves on the road.\n\nHe didn’t know who’d they’d sent. The police, the army, could even be the damn Royal Guard; it didn’t matter in the end. They were going to be taken away and shot just for making pamphlets, but Gravel Pathway had no intention of going quietly. While he was a road builder by trade, he knew how to tear up tarmac as much as he knew how to lay it.\n\nHe could hear bullets ricocheting off the dark side passage as his pursuers took shots at the fleeing ponies. Gravel’s horn flared to life, lifting the pavement to shield himself and the other ponies from the gunfire. He couldn’t do this for long, but if it meant his friends got away then he’d exhaust himself trying.\n\n“Drop the magic and we’ll take you in quietly! Nopony needs get hurt!” One of the soldiers ordered.\n\nGravel threw the pavement chunk at them, only for it to slam into the shield of one of the unicorn soldiers. Then it was all over, a blow to the back of his head from a pegasus he hadn’t seen or heard sent him face first into the torn-up road.\n\n“You are under arrest for crimes against the empire and for destruction of civic property, and your friends won’t be far behind you.”\n\nThe sound of hooves on concrete reached his ears. The unicorn could just barely make out Black Hoof charging at the pegasus, hoping to catch the soldier off guard only for the crack of gunfire to send him to the ground. Gravel’s eyes widened in shock, but another blow from the pegasus ended what remained of his struggle."

 paxsolaris.174.t:0 "Order Restored"
 paxsolaris.174.d:0 "The concrete caved in like paper under the force of crimson magic, and Starlight Glimmer knew the end was near. In the final moments of the Harmony Restoration Movement, she could only ruminate on the decisions that led up to this moment. Had it been worth it? If Trixie was here, she would have said yes, but the mare had failed to return from the frontlines a week ago. What of the thousands of soldiers who’d given their lives for a doomed cause? Or the countless civilians who’d seen their homes torn up by war?\n\nIt was all over and Starlight had nothing to show for it but a heavy heart. She mourned for the loss of innocent lives and raged against the injustice of it all, but above all she was disappointed in herself. She’d promised freedom and failed to deliver. Perhaps her failed revolution might serve as an inspiration to a future generation, but that did little to comfort her now that she was alone in the dark tunnels of the Manehattan Underground, having sent all her aides away in the hopes that they would be overlooked by the Royal Guard.\n\n“Starlight Glimmer, your revolution is over,” Daybreaker spoke, her voice assertive yet strained. “Stand down and face justice for your crimes against ponykind.”\n\nStarlight met her gaze and was surprised to see that the alicorn looked just as tired as the unicorn felt. Briefly, she considered fighting. If she struck quickly, she might kill two or three of Daybreaker’s guards before the alicorn could incinerate her. She decided against it. Starlight was so sick of death, and it seemed her foes were as well. So many had already perished, and it seemed wrong to add to that number out of pure spite. Accepting her fate, the unicorn bowed her head and allowed a guard to slip a magic suppressor on her horn."

 paxsolaris.175.d:0 "“Your majesty, the convoy is waiting,” A Royal Guard informed the alicorn.\n\n“Tell them to leave without me,” Daybreaker ordered. “I will make my own way to Canterlot.”\n\nThe guard bowed his head. “As you wish.”\n\nHe took off to join the others, leaving Daybreaker with nothing but the distant ocean breeze for company. She stood on the warped bronze head of the Crystaller Building, overlooking the rest of Manehattan with an almost imperceptible frown. She should be happy. Starlight was in chains, Trixie was presumed dead, and the resistance had been shattered, yet the alicorn just felt tired.\n\nNopony would be surprised to learn that the solar monarch had seen a lot of war in her life. She had spent more years on battlefields than most ponies had lived and was well accustomed to sights of death and ruin. While most of Manehattan had survived, rubble and corpses littered the streets. The fighting had been bloody as pegasi shock troopers were forced to clear each building top-down before ground forces could advance. Daybreaker had accepted these sacrifices as necessary for Equestria, but that didn’t stop her from mourning them.\n\nShe could feel the weight of her years on her shoulders. Every decision, every responsibility, every death, it all added to this invisible load. For better or worse, alicorns forgot nothing. Their minds were as timeless as their bodies, but not nearly as durable. The pale and lifeless faces strewn across the streets of Manehattan would live on forever in Daybreaker’s memories, joining the countless millions from wars forgotten by history.\n\nDaybreaker growled and pushed aside her melancholy thoughts. Today had been a tremendous victory for ponykind. The traitors had been purged and order had been restored."

He jammed another magazine into his rifle and took aim at the trees. “Now get moving!”\n\nCinder hoisted the rifle onto his shoulders and stepped back, giving the stallion one final nod. “It’s been an honour serving with you.”\n\nBlood and mud stained his white coat, the product of countless weeks of nonstop fighting. As the frontlines had collapsed, the 132nd Regiment had been left behind. They had fought through all the hellfire the Harmony Restoration Movement could throw at them, but now these two dozen ponies were all that remained, and Cinder feared the worst.\n\nNo sooner had he leapt behind the hastily improvised dirt barrier did a tremendous explosion send his eardrums ringing. When the dust faded, all that was left of Torchfire was bits of clothing. Cinder gritted his teeth and sent another hail of bullets at the harmonists, watching as another five collapsed to the ground. It wasn’t enough. It would never be enough. This hill would be his final resting place, but he’d be damned if he didn’t drag all these traitors to the afterlife with him.\n\n“Shout your curses and say your prayers, soldiers! This will be our final stand!” Cinder bellowed over the cracks of the rifles and screams of the dying. “In the name of the Empress, we will not lose this hill!”\n\nFor eight hours the dozen ponies of the 132nd Regiment stood as an immovable barrier against all the H.R.M. could throw at them. They made the harmonists pay dearly for every inch of ground they gave up. One by one they died, joining the unnamed hundreds who had already perished at the foot of the hill until only Cinder was left. He lay at the base of an old tree, holding an empty pistol in his hooves as he bled out. With the last of his strength, he turned to the horizon. The sun had risen once again. Just as it always had. Just as it always would."

 paxsolaris.177.d:0 "Daybreaker levitated a teacup to her lips as she flipped through the new reports on resistance activity. Even now, on the eve of her greatest triumph, the Empress was not above paperwork. She could delegate, but the alicorn refused to leave such an important task as national security in the hooves of some bureaucrat.\n\nThe Harmony Restoration Movement may have fallen, but new organisations had emerged to replace it. Reading through the files, one name kept reappearing. Oynx Bolt. The Inquisitors complained how he seemed to know their every move in advance while spies in the resistance reported that many were already rallying to him as the de-facto successor to Starlight and Trixie. Even in Canterlot, the media had begun broadcasting warnings about the new terrorist threat.\n\nA new leader had taken up the mantle of leading the resistance, but Daybreaker couldn’t be happier. Unknown to all but the highest echelons of solar government, Oynx Bolt was actually Candle Flame, a loyal Imperial spy planted in the H.R.M. months ago by the Imperial Inquisition. With donations from ‘anonymous benefactors’ and advanced warning on Inquisitorial actions, ponies like Candle Flame had secured their place at the top of the anti-Daybreaker hierarchy. Instructing the media to report on the newest ‘threat’ was enough for the stallion to become the one the partisans turn to for leadership.\n\nThey didn’t know it yet, but the rebels had placed their heads on the chopping block. Even if this treachery were to come to light, there were too many spies embedded in the harmonist networks for any new organisation to rise. Equestria was now under her complete control. There would be no more rebellions and no more attacks. That era had come and passed."

 paxsolaris.178.t:0 "The End of Hope"
 paxsolaris.178.d:0 "Steel Pick had always been a determined stallion. Even as a foal he’d always given his all to defend what was important to him. That was why he had become a soldier, that was why he had left the army to join the resistance and that was why he sat here now, waiting in this damp basement in the dead of night with only a dim candle, a bottle of rum and a decaying printing press for company.\n\nHe questioned why nopony else had shown up. Had the others been some of the unlucky few to be found by the Inquisition, or had they simply given up and accepted Daybreaker like so many of his former comrades? Whatever the reason, Steel Pick knew he would be alone again for this weekly meetup. He sighed and took a long drink from the bottle.\n\nOnce upon a time, ten ponies had crowded around this printing press, making posters to rally others to their cause. Then it was eight. Then four. The governor didn’t even bother to take down the posters anymore. Why would she, when the state hadn’t seen a single resistance attack in months? The posters were just left to rot away in the rain or bleach under the sun, a potent metaphor for what the Harmony Restoration Movement had become.\n\nThe stallion tipped back the bottle just as a sharp knocking reached his ears, accompanied by a tired voice.\n\n“Imperial Inquisition. We know you’re in there. Come along quietly and nopony gets hurt.”\n\nThe earth pony heaved a long sigh. Even the Inquisitors weren’t taking them seriously anymore, and why would they? The resistance was a joke now. A beaten and dying joke.\n\nFor the first time in his life, Steel Pick considered just giving up. Was this dead dream worth his life? Would he let this tired and uncaring Inquisitor tell his crying sisters that her brother had died resisting arrest? Daybreaker had beaten them all, and no amount of determination would change that.\n\nHe sighed again and stumbled to his feet."

In all his years as a soldier and strike team leader, he never suffered so much as a scratch in the line of duty. But after only a few months in the Imperial Royal Guard and a stray bullet had ended his days of front-line service. He counted himself lucky he even got to return home to his family. Many others were not so fortunate.\n\nEven now, putting on his uniform sent throbbing pain up his spine, but the unicorn was determined to look his best. The Solar Custodian was an important mare, after all.\n\n“Sparking Flame,” Sunset Shimmer spoke up as she stepped out of the other room. “A pleasure as always.”\n\nHe snapped into a quick salute. “The pleasure is all mine, Lady Custodian.”\n\n“As you have probably heard, the Inquisition is to be disbanded,” Sunset began, not wasting time any more time with pleasantries. “Equestria has entered a new era of peace and there is little reason for such an organisation to exist now. Their members and resources are to be split between the Imperial Investigative Service, headed by Twilight Sparkle, and the Department of Internal Security, headed by [sol_dis_leader_name].”\n\n“Am I to be transferred, madam?” Sparking Flame asked.\n\nA dangerous look passed over the mare’s face, but it was gone as quickly as it came. “No, the Solar Task Forces will remain under my direct command, but I have a more important role for you. In light of your exemplary performance on the field, I have recommended you to the Empress for a promotion to general.”\n\n“A… a general?” The stallion stammered before he caught himself bowed his head. “Thank you, Lady Custodian, for giving me this opportunity to serve our Empress.

 paxsolaris.180.d:0 "Now he understood why the housing was so cheap. It wasn’t that the flat was bad or built in a substandard fashion. On the contrary, his new home was more than adequate for a high-rise apartment. All the new technology was here, even one of those new microwaves he’d heard about on the radio.\n\nNo, this apartment was affordable because there was a surplus of space here, with hundreds or thousands moving to the marvellous new cities that had sprung up across the nation, all part of the Empress’ initiative to put Equestria at the forefront of technology and development. Buses, trams, trains, a massive airport and enough green spaces to make it feel truly alive. It was all here, working in unison under a strict schedule. It was one thing to discover his hometown was now a thriving metropolis; but the prices made it an offer he simply couldn’t refuse.\n\nScarlet Penny, his wife, piped up from across the room; buried in school pamphlets. “I’ve been looking at schools for the kids here and… well… there’s so many choices, I wasn’t expecting them to have this many preschools. Listen to this… ‘free extracurricular mentoring programs to help your foals find their cutie-marks and prepare them for careers in emerging industries.’” She read aloud from the paper in her hooves.\n\nLeather Duster turned and trotted towards her gleefully. It was all so perfect. They would have more money, more space and a better standard of living than either of their parents. As a new family, the state was even willing to pay a portion of their mortgage for every foal they had.\n\nThe mare turned to her husband and looked at him with suddenly sultry eyes.\n\n“I think we should plan for more than just two foals.

 paxsolaris.200.d:0 "Velvet Arrow’s footsteps echoed through the still night air. The yellow street lamps cast long shadows across the bombed-out Whinnyapolis street, illuminating the withered remains of houses and factories. Normally he would avoid places like this, but tonight there was somepony he had to meet.\n\n“You’re late,” A voice broke the silence. Velvet turned and saw an orange unicorn standing near the blackened remains of a house.\n\n“Is that you, Sparking?” Velvet asked.\n\nThe stallion looked up and tilted his head slightly in acknowledgement. “It is good to see you, old friend.”\n\nIt felt odd to be addressed that way by a pony Velvet had never met in his life. But that was the greeting Dotted Line had told him to memorise. The unicorn was the only informant [THIS.GetNameDef] had in the Whinnyapolis resistance cell and would be Velvet’s ticket to getting close to the resistance leaders. From the files Velvet had read on the stallion, Sparking Flame had been part of a mage company in the war before the Whinnyapolis cell approached him. Despite that, Velvet couldn’t shake the nagging fear he was walking into a trap, even though Dotted Line had vouched for the unicorn’s loyalty.\n\n“Come, the meeting is about to start,” Sparking beckoned him forward. Velvet followed him down the winding alley, past the ash and ruins. The earth pony shifted his shoulders, feeling the familiar weight of the service pistol strapped to his torso. At least he wasn’t defenceless\n\nSparking Flame reached the door to a derelict warehouse and turned back to him. “You’re going to get a kick out of this. Watch.”\n\nWithout another word, he stepped through the doorway and shimmered out of existence. The earth pony hesitated for a moment before closing his eyes and stepping in after him. It felt like moving through a plane of water. He opened his eyes and saw ponies milling around, surrounding a warm fire built at the foot of a large stage. The interior of the warehouse had completely changed, going from derelict and abandoned to a hive of activity. Velvet Arrow was no mage, but even he knew such a concealment charm would require a very talented unicorn. No wonder Dotted was giving this mission so much attention.\n\nA pink mare trotted onto the stage. She seemed nervous, but a blue unicorn pushed her forward. Emboldened by her friend, the mare stepped up to the microphone."

 paxsolaris.201.d:0 "“A warm welcome to everypony. I thank you for taking the risk in attending this meeting. All of you have travelled far, risking death, imprisonment or worse for one common goal: overthrowing the tyrant that has taken control of Equestria. Many of you know me as Starlight Glimmer; ex-cult leader, socialist and student of Princess Twilight Sparkle. I will not hide my past nor expect you to agree with me, but I beg of you, please listen to reason.\n\n“My fellow ponies, we are at a tipping point. Celestia has forsaken harmony in favour of a twisted iron-hooved mockery. She has turned her back on freedom and chosen to bring about a totalitarian state where ponykind will be reduced to nothing but mindless minions beneath her cruel hooves.\n\n“I know many of you have no love for Celestia and have been expecting this moment for a long time. And I cannot blame you. But for the sake of overthrowing our mutual foe, anarchists, separatists, socialists, Luna and Nightmare supporters alike must work together with the believers in the old ways, lest Daybreaker come for us all.”\n\nA thestral scoffed. “I didn’t see any of you help us when Celestia turned a blind eye to the prejudice and suffering our kind faced! You speak of Celestia abandoning freedom like she ever gave us any. Why should the clans help you?”\n\nStarlight gave the thestral a sympathetic smile. “I cannot fault your logic. Ignoring the plight of your people was cruel and unjust, something we should be ashamed of. But we must put our grievances aside. Daybreaker threatens us all, if we cannot work with each other we will fall one by one until there is nothing left. If you won’t do it for Equestria, do it for Luna.”\n\nThe thestral took a moment to think about it then nodded. Starlight sighed in relief and resumed her speech.\n\n“To stand a chance against the tyrant, we must present a united front and strike hard before ponykind can grow accustomed to their chains. We have few weapons and no unifying direction. Our only hope rests in a quick and decapitating strike. I will not lie, the next few months will be hard. They will make or break our ability to resist Daybreaker’s tyranny. But I promise you, together we can save our future!”\n\nThe crowd erupted into applause. Velvet Arrow glanced around nervously. This was no angry mob. This was a united and motivated force that could topple an empire."
 paxsolaris.201.a:0 "Dotted Line will not be happy to hear about this."

 paxsolaris.202.t:0 "Velvet's Report"
 paxsolaris.202.d:0 "Velvet watched as Dotted Line sifted through the disorganised files. With most of S.M.I.L.E having defected, the older stallion was transferred from his job as Cabinet Secretary to managing the tattered remains of the now disavowed agency. And while he had made no secret of his displeasure, Dotted had about as much chance of getting his old job back as Velvet did.\n\nHe regretted having ever complained. Intercepting and decoding the letters of Changeling spies might have been boring, but at least it was safe.\n\nDotted looked up, having finally found the file he was looking for. “So, you are absolutely certain Starlight Glimmer is organising this resistance?”\n\nVelvet nodded. “After that meeting I spent three days in a resistance training camp. She was there the entire time. Trust me, it’s her.”\n\n“This isn’t good. According to these old S.M.I.L.E documents, she’s a powerful unicorn and not to be underestimated,” The stallion skimmed through the file. “Resourceful... talented... Daybreaker’s flaming tits, she can travel through time. I’ll need to organise a strike team to tail you to the next meeting.”\n\n“Sir, you can’t do this!” Velvet leapt out of his chair. It took him a moment to realise he had spoken up.\n\nHis boss raised an eyebrow. “And why not?”\n\nThe earth pony's resolve faltered under the scrutinising gaze of his superior. But this was something Dotted Line needed to know. \n\n“Even if your raid succeeds, you’re only going to eliminate twenty resistance members at best. They will blacklist Sparking and I from every resistance cell in the country. The two of us are the only ponies to have made inroads into any important resistance network. Destroy our cover and we might as well be blind,” Velvet finishes his explanation. He might be terrified to remain under the watchful eyes of trained killers, but the sobering truth was if he quit now then nopony would replace him. At least not quickly enough to make a difference. \n\nDotted Line leaned back on his chair and sighed. “You make a lot of sense. But I have a greater chance of assassinating Starlight now than you do gaining her trust.”\n\nVelvet bit his tongue and nodded."

 paxsolaris.203.d:0 "Velvet Arrow crept through the dark forest, trying hard to hide his nervousness. Though the pitch-black clouds concealed them, Velvet knew there were pegasi strike teams hovering just above the canopies. He met Sparking’s eyes for a minute, and the two stallions shared a look of concern. Neither of them was happy with Dotted’s decision. But that wasn’t the only reason they were nervous. Velvet swore there were eyes watching him through the trees, malevolent and hungry.\n\nWhen they finally arrived at the new training camp, the blue unicorn he’d later learnt was named Trixie greeted them. She addressed the stallions like friends and brought them to an open-air mess hall where nearly a hundred other resistance fighters had gathered. It was nearly midnight when Starlight emerged from her tent to address them. “My friends, you don’t know how relieved I feel to see so many familiar faces here. You give me hope that Equestria is not yet lost. I promise to all of you that-”\n\nThe night was suddenly filled with the sounds of screaming and the barking of rifles. Velvet watched in mute shock as a dozen resistance fighters went down instantly. The rout turned into a full-blown panic when dark shapes soared out of the clouds and began torching the tents.\n\n“They’ve found us!” A pony screamed.\n\nStarlight hesitated only a moment before summoning a shimmering cyan shield over the crowd. It flickered under the hail of bullets. “Quickly, grab any weapons you can and make for the trees!”\n\nThe barrier only held for a few more moments before it shattered. Starlight teleported into the forest, taking as many ponies with her as she could. Velvet raced after the unicorn, holding his pistol in his mouth. He ducked through streams of bullets and forced his way into the treeline. It wasn’t long before he found Starlight in an open clearing. She ignited her horn, then relaxed. “Oh my, you startled me! Quickly, we need to get the survivors to safety!”\n\nA faint whooshing noise reached his ear as a pegasus shot through the canopies. Before Starlight could even summon her magic, the pegasus had levelled a rifle at her. Velvet didn't have time to think. The only thing he knew was that a pony was about to have her life snuffed out. He leapt forward..."
 paxsolaris.203.a:0 "...and pushed Starlight out of the bullet's path."

 paxsolaris.204.t:0 "Saving Starlight"
 paxsolaris.204.d:0 "It all happened in slow motion. Before he could even ponder his actions, Velvet leapt at Starlight, pushing her out of the bullet’s path. A blue aura appeared around the gun, preventing the pegasus from squeezing the trigger a second time. Trixie stepped out of the underbrush, looking positively murderous as she yanked the machine gun out of her opponent’s hooves and spun it around to point at the pegasus' heart. Realising she was now defenceless, the pegasus retreated into the sky.\n\nTrixie waited a few seconds to make sure she wouldn't double back then galloped over to her friend. “Starlight, are you alright?”\n\nStarlight rolled to her hooves and stood up. “I am, thanks to our friend here,” She gazed at him with wide eyes. “Thank you.”\n\nVelvet tried to brush it off, but inside his heart was thundering in his chest. What was he thinking? He’d just saved the leader of the resistance! The insurgent plotting the downfall of his country!\n\n“Oh my gosh, you’re bleeding!” Trixie exclaimed, pointing at his flank. Blood coated his leg, dripping from a vicious gash in his flank.\n\n“Well, would you look at that...” Velvet murmured. He suddenly felt very light-headed as his adrenaline faded. His eyes rolled to the back of his skull and he collapsed, dead to the world."
 paxsolaris.204.a:0 "What have I done?"

 paxsolaris.214.t:0 "Starlight's Lament"
 paxsolaris.214.d:0 "When Velvet Arrow awoke, it was to unfamiliar surroundings. He was in a dark brown tent, illuminated by lamps that flickered in a light breeze. Slowly he pushed himself to his hooves, then realised he wasn’t alone. Starlight Glimmer was waiting for him, a curious expression on her face.\n\n“You’re up,” She stated.\n\nHe raised an eyebrow. “It would certainly seem that way.”\n\n“Look, I just want to say thank you again,” Starlight admitted. “You saved my life and you don’t even know me.”\n\n“You’re the resistance leader, are you not?” Velvet replied, trying to downplay her gratitude. He didn't deserve it. Saving her had been pure instinct on his part. If he'd been given the time to make a conscious decision, he would have let Starlight die.\n\nStarlight sighed and avoided his gaze. “Some resistance leader I am, letting Daybreaker’s minions follow me to our hideout. Ponies are dead, Velvet. And it’s all my fault.”\n\nA part of him felt relieved she wasn’t blaming him or Sparking Flame. The other part felt guilty Starlight was blaming herself for something he was responsible for, in spite of his better judgement.\n\n“I’m not Twilight, or Luna, or even one of the Element Bearers,” Starlight continued, oblivious to his inner conflict. She took a seat at the edge of the tent, hanging her head in defeat. “I don’t know the first thing about leading. But if anypony ever found out I don’t know what I’m doing, it would crush what little hope we have left.”\n\n“Well, I think you’re doing a pretty good job,” Velvet told her. He certainly knew what it was like for fate to thrust you into a role you weren’t prepared for. At least she was a better resistance leader than he was a spy.\n\nStarlight smiled at him."
 paxsolaris.214.a:0 "“Thank you, Velvet.”"

 paxsolaris.205.t:0 "Training Days"
 paxsolaris.205.d:0 "Velvet held the rifle in his hooves and fired off five shots. Moments later two metallic pings reached his ear and the earth pony exhaled, letting the barrel drop.\n\n“Not going to lie, that was pretty bad,” Sparking Flame deadpanned. He peered over Velvet’s shoulder at the five metal cans they’d tied to a tree in the distance. “Two out of five. Disappointing.”\n\n“In my defence, I was a codebreaker before all this.”\n\n“Sorry, Velvet. But I must side with Sparking,” A green pegasus chuckled. “That was awful.”\n\n“Shut your gob, Lefty,” Velvet glared at the pegasus, but there was no energy behind it. Lefty was a naturally friendly stallion, so it was hard to stay angry at him. Velvet idly wondered if he would be as friendly if he knew he was spending his leisure hour in the company of two solar spies.\n\n“Why don’t you show him how it’s done, hey Sparky?” Lefty nudged the unicorn with his wing, flashing him a beaming grin.\n\n“Maybe later,” Sparking dismissed the pegasus. Velvet raised an eyebrow. It wasn’t like his friend unicorn to be this sullen."
 paxsolaris.205.a:0 "“Is something wrong?” Velvet asked."
 paxsolaris.209.d:0 "“It’s my filly’s birthday,” Sparking sighed. “She’d be turning four today.”\n\n“Wait, you have a kid?” Lefty sat next to the unicorn, his earlier lightheartedness replaced by a worried frown.\n\n“Six,” Sparking corrected. He smiled at the disbelieving looks the two other stallions were giving him and shrugged. “What can I say, I’m a family stallion. My oldest should be sixteen by now, so at least he can help his mother with the other five.\n\n“That’s true. But you don’t have to pretend being away from your family isn’t hard,” Lefty consoled, draping a wing over the stallion. “I have a younger sister I haven’t seen in months. It’s hard, but our families are the reason we fight. We want to create a better world for them.\n\n“Trust me, Lefty. I wouldn’t be here if I didn’t want to make the world a better place for my family.” There was something dark in Sparking’s eyes. A simmering rage that would incinerate anything it was directed against. Right now, that rage was focused entirely Lefty and everything he stood for. But it disappeared the moment the pegasus glanced back at the unicorn, replaced by a disarming smile.\n\n“Well, I think it’s about time I show you ladies how to shoot properly,” Sparking levitated the gun to his hooves and took aim, firing a quick five shots at the cans in rapid succession."
 paxsolaris.209.a:0 "He didn’t miss a single one."

 paxsolaris.206.t:0 "Assassination Foiled"
 paxsolaris.206.d:0 "“Sir, I just wanted to report that-” Velvet spoke into the radio, but Dotted Line cut him off.\n\n“I already know our assassination attempt was foiled. One of the pegasi reported Starlight's followers successfully protected her during the attack.”\n\nVelvet let go of a breath he didn’t know he was holding. Dotted didn’t seem to know it had been him who had saved Starlight. By the Empress, he hoped he’d never have to admit to the shameful treason he’d committed that night.\n\n“So, what are my orders, sir?” Velvet asked.\n\n“Continue with your infiltration. Try and see what you can find out about this attack the resistance is planning.”"
 paxsolaris.206.a:0 "“It will be done, sir.”"

 paxsolaris.207.t:0 "Starlight's Request"
 paxsolaris.207.d:0 "Velvet Arrow gulped down air as he ran, pushing his aching muscles to complete another lap of the field. Starlight’s drill sergeant, a burly Stalliongradian pegasus named Crimson Nova, was pushing the poor earth pony harder than he’d ever been pushed in his life\n\nThe sound of hooves on dirt reached his ear as Sparking Flame pulled up beside him. The orange stallion grinned. “Having fun, greenhorn?”\n\n“Buck off,” Velvet shot back between heavy breaths. He was embarrassed to see a unicorn running laps around him. Weren’t earth ponies supposed to have the best endurance of the three tribes?\n\n“You just need to find your rhythm,” Sparking advised. “Anyway, I’m going to complete a few more laps. I’ll catch up with you after dinner.”\n\nThe unicorn accelerated away, leaving Velvet in the dust. Dark spots appeared in his vision, but he forced himself to continue.\n\n“Velvet Arrow, get your sorry flank over here!” Crimson Nova shouted. Velvet’s heart sank. What did he want now? The earth pony turned and found the pegasus beckoning him forward. To his surprise, Starlight was waiting next to the stallion. Different scenarios were running through Velvet’s brain, each more daunting than the last. Did she know he was a spy?\n\n“Thanks for letting me borrow one of your men, Crimson,” Starlight nodded to the pegasus.\n\n“It is no problem, Comrade Glimmer,” Crimson Nova saluted and flew back to the field, hurling obscenities at the other recruits from the air.\n\nStarlight greeted Velvet with a polite nod. “I asked a few of my comrades about you. Why didn’t you tell me you used to be a S.M.I.L.E agent?”\n\n“I didn’t think it was that important. I graduated as an agent, but I was only part of the agency for two years and spent most of my time decoding letters,” Velvet told her. For once, he was being truthful. “With all the survivors of Daybreaker’s purge joining the resistance, I didn’t think you’d be desperate enough to need somepony like me.”\n\n“I’ve been watching you,” Starlight admitted. “You show admirable resilience and a quick instinct. I think I could use your help for something important.”\n\nVelvet raised an eyebrow. “What could you need my help for?”"
 paxsolaris.207.a:0 "“You’ll see,” she replied ominously."

 paxsolaris.208.t:0 "Meeting the Resistance"
 paxsolaris.208.d:0 "Starlight led him to a large tent at the edge of the resistance base. Velvet followed her through the tent and found himself facing a circle of ponies. At least, he thought they were ponies. While most of them wouldn’t look out of place in Canterlot, there were others who’d stick out like a sore thumb. Some of those ponies wore the black and red colours of the anarchist gangs, others wore Stalliongradian uniforms or the black and blues of Nightmare cultists. A thestral who appeared more bat than pony took one look at him and sneered. “Starlight, what is this pony doing here?”\n\n“This is a friend of mine,” Starlight told them. “He saved my life.”\n\n“And why did you bring him here?” The thestral asked.\n\n“He has a background in interpreting coded communication. I thought we could use a second pair of eyes on the intel we gained.”\n\n“I say let him look,” One of the Stalliongradians spoke up. “If Starlight trusts him, I don’t see why we shouldn’t too.”\n\nStarlight nodded at the stallion and levitated a sealed telegram over to Velvet. He took the paper in his hooves and raised an eyebrow at Starlight.\n\n“The Las Pegasus cell intercepted this a week ago. We’ve already decoded it as best we can, but I want to see if you can derive any meaning from these last few sentences,” She instructed, gesturing to a jumbled mess of symbols."
 paxsolaris.208.a:0 "Velvet examined the strange letter closely."

 paxsolaris.215.d:0 "He didn’t recognise this code, but it wasn’t like the West Coast command were going to give some nopony from the Heartland region their codebook. So Velvet would have to decode this message the old-fashioned way. A daunting task for most ponies. But Velvet hadn’t spent two years picking apart the nearly-illegible Changeling script without learning a thing or two.\n\n“It’s a military requisition order,” Velvet said after a long pause. “High Command wants Las Pegasus to facilitate the transfer of troops from the Heartland to the Frontier.”\n\nStarlight nodded. “That confirms what our scouts have reported. Daybreaker wants to secure the frontiers so badly she’s left her heart wide open. And we intend to exploit her ambition.”\n\n“Da! We will skewer the monarch!” The Stalliongradian spoke up.\n\nThe thestral shook his head. “This empire is more than just one pony. It is an institution. We must uproot it at the base.”\n\n“We can’t just wipe out the entirety of Canterlot,” One of the anarchists scoffed. “Just focus on their military high command. Without a military, Daybreaker’s empire will crumble around her.”\n\n“Why should we not wipe out the sun-worshippers?” The thestral shot back.\n\n“Alright, that’s enough!” Starlight shouted, causing the room to fall silent. “We will decide on our target like civilised ponies. And no, Umbra, we will not be killing civilians if we can avoid it.”\n\nThe thestral glared at her, but he didn’t comment.\n\nSeeing the hostility in the room, Starlight sighed and turned to Velvet. “Well, what do you think we should do? Should we focus on assassinating Daybreaker herself, or target her military high command?”"

It meant [THIS.GetNameDef] still had an infiltrator in the resistance. But the news the agent had delivered had been anything but relieving. An attack on Canterlot itself? It sounded like a suicide plan. But if Starlight thought they could pull it off, he was inclined to believe her.\n\nBy the Empress, he needed a drink. But first he needed to draft their defensive plan.\n\nIt went without saying that he would need to call in the military. Canterlot itself would need the most defenses, but for a solid defence checkpoints in the surrounding states would be required.\n\nBut the military wasn’t here. Daybreaker had ordered them to the empire’s frontiers to defend against foreign invasion. It would be almost impossible to muster this many troops on such short notice. He could ease the burden by drawing civilian garrisons from surrounding states, but that could leave the Heartland defenceless. If anything were to happen to the unprotected states, they would blame Daybreaker for throwing them to timberwolves to save Canterlot elites.\n\nThe Cabinet Secretary sighed.

Halfway into their advance on the capital, orders had come in that they were to move on Whinnyapolis instead. While others had been confused, Velvet had been relieved. He hadn’t been given the chance to warn Dotted Line before the attack on Whinnyapolis began, but the resistance looting arms warehouses was an infinitely better outcome to the destruction of Canterlot. But Starlight must have narrowed the leak to the Whinnyapolis cell. Now she had come to plug it.\n\nThe unicorn stepped onto the podium to deliver the news.

Our spies in Canterlot reported a massive military buildup around the city. Daybreaker drew forces from all across Equestria to fortify her capital. Going forth with our plan would’ve been suicide.”\n\n“You said the city would be defenceless!” The pony cried.\n\nFor a brief moment, Starlight looked like she’d aged two decades. Then she was back to being the confident and in-control resistance leader.\n\n“It was. But Daybreaker caught word of our attack. And that means we have a spy,” Starlight told them.

Only when they had made it to the forest did he speak up again. “Were either of you in a mage company?”\n\n“What do you think?” The pegasus shot back, ruffling her wings for emphasis.\n\n“No, I suppose not. Pity. You’d never meet finer ponies. I don’t mean to brag, but I was part of a particularly elite company. The Canterlot 43rd.”\n\n“Oh will you shut up!” The earth pony guard demanded. “I wouldn’t be smiling if I was you. Starlight may want us to be merciful, but I’m tempted to just shoot your kneecaps and leave you to the timberwolves.”\n\n“They taught us a pretty useful skill,” Sparking continued, ignoring the outburst. He raised his hoof to his chin. “It’s not something I’m fond of doing. But when the situation demands it...”\n\nA sickening crack pierced the silence. The two guards spun around to see Sparking Flame shaking the magic suppressor off his horn, his jaw hanging freely. The pegasus squeezed her trigger, but her shots bounced off an orange shield and into the forest. Sparking grabbed the earth pony by her back legs in a telekinetic grip then swung her at the pegasus, sending both guards into a tree. Before either of them could recover a bolt of magical fire engulfed the duo. When the light faded, all that remained of the guards were cooling piles of ash.\n\nSparking Flame stepped around the remains, picking up the dropped rifles as he passed. He trotted through the forest, eventually coming across the radio he’d hidden in a withered tree all those weeks ago."

 paxsolaris.220.d:0 "Sunset Shimmer watched as Daybreaker levitated the teacup to her lips and took a dainty sip, sighing in contentment. It would seem her transformation had not dulled her love for tea. Sunset took a sip from her own cup. Truthfully, she had never cared for her mentor’s favourite drink. But Sunset would take any opportunity to spend time with her mother figure.\n\n“I am glad you could spare the time to join me, Sunset. I understand your work reforming the Imperial Royal Guard into a more useful organisation has left you quite busy as of late.”\n\n“It is of no concern, your majesty,” Sunset bowed her head. “I’m glad to do my part in improving the empire.”\n\n“And you are doing a fine job,” Daybreaker smiled, making Sunset feel warm and fuzzy inside. “They will soon be ready to carry out my will. But until then, I have a job for you. I trust you have heard rumours of my latest project?”\n\n“I may have heard of it,” Sunset replied. The Imperial Inquisition was supposed to be top secret until they were ready to be unveiled. But some ponies had a terrible habit of running their mouths.\n\n“Good, then you know how important this project is. I need you to conduct a top-to-bottom audit of the Imperial Inquisition before we take action against Starlight’s band of traitors. All our efforts would be wasted if Starlight has managed to slip a spy into the organisation.”\n\nSunset took another sip of tea and nodded. “A valid concern. We cannot allow the Inquisition to be infested with traitors like S.M.I.L.E.”\n\n“My thoughts exactly. You may coordinate efforts with Dotted Line. He is trustworthy. Anypony else must be considered a suspect. I’ll leave you to decide what should be done with any traitors you find.”"

Sparking Flame sniggered at the sight and offered another beer to the stallion while he sipped his own through a straw. It was the only way he could drink with his jaw still in a cast.\n\n“Did you really say that in front of Starlight Glimmer?” Dotted finally managed to say. Sparking nodded and the grey unicorn burst into another fit of laughter. “You’re a bloody madmare. I don’t think my Inquisition could afford another stallion like you in our ranks.”\n\n“Ah, but it’s not your Inquisition anymore, is it?” Sparking shot back. “Last I heard, you’re serving out your last week before returning to the Civil Service.”\n\n“Oh yes, my ‘demotion’,” Dotted rolled his eyes. “I sure will miss the long hours and constant stress of managing an entire intelligence agency by myself. I tell you, when I got the news I was so shocked my jaw hit the floor.”\n\n“Oh go fu- AH!” Sparking cried out as he accidentally moved his broken jaw. He glared as Dotted Line laughed at his discomfort. But that laughter died when he spotted the figure standing in the doorway.\n\n“Drinking on the job?” Sunset Shimmer scowled at the two stallions. “You’re supposed to be hunting the resistance.”\n\nDotted Line shivered at the sight of the mare. Sunset Shimmer had shown up from gods knows where and had already been granted command over the entire Imperial Royal Guard. She had wasted no time in reforming them into the cold and merciless executors of Daybreaker’s will. The rumours he’d heard about what the Royal Guard had been turned into were enough to make even him nervous.\n\n“Leave us,” Sunset ordered. Sparking Flame gave his friend a sympathetic look then quickly left, not wishing to invoke Sunset’s ire. Now alone, Sunset turned to the grey stallion. “The Empress has called for a complete audit of all inquisitorial personnel. You will provide me with files on everypony who works here.”\n\n“I do hope the Empress is not displeased by the delay this audit will cause.”\n\n“Leave Daybreaker to me. Just get the files sorted. Expect my arrival early tomorrow morning.”\n\n“How detailed do you want these files?” Dotted Line asked. “You must remember that we are on a time schedule. If we spend too long hunting traitors in the Inquisition we give the traitors abroad time to strengthen themselves.”"

He had yet to prove himself loyal, but at least he had proved himself competent.\n\n“Nineteen traitors,” Dotted remarked, frowning at the notes. “I’m not going to lie; I didn’t expect there to be that many.”\n\nSunset narrowed her eyes. “You would be wise to improve your vetting process if you wish to remain in the Empress’ good graces.”\n\n“Yes, I promise you this will not happen again,” Dotted replied.

 paxsolaris.224.d:0 "Inquisitors leapt to the side as Sunset Shimmer stormed down the hallway to Dotted Line’s office, flanked on either side by two heavily armed Imperial Royal Guards. Not bothering to knock, Sunset flung open his door.\n\nThe grey stallion leapt up in shock. “What is the meaning of this!?”\n\nSunset scowled. “You’re smart enough to know why I’m here. There was an information leak. Starlight Glimmer and Trixie Lulamoon were given advanced warning about our attack, that’s why they managed to evacuate so many ponies. The Imperial Royal Guards are clean. That leaves your Inquisition as the weak link.”\n\n“Er, yes. I have been conducting a very thorough second audit and have located the spy,” Dotted told her. “I was just about to give the arrest order before you barged in here.”\n\n“It’s an Imperial Royal Guard matter now. Show me to the spy’s office,” Sunset commanded.\n\nDotted Line sighed. “Very well then. Though I would appreciate it if you let me manage inquisitorial affairs.”\n\n“Your concern is noted and disregarded,” Sunset snapped back. She commanded her two soldiers to follow Dotted Line as he led them through the Inquisition’s headquarters. Trailing behind, Sunset took the moment to survey the ponies she passed. They flinched away when her gaze fell upon them.\n\nFinally, they arrived at an office. The blinds were closed and the door locked. Sunset wasted no time blasting the door off and marching inside, but what she saw gave her pause. A pegasus stallion hung in the middle of the room, dangling from the ceiling by a piece of rope tied around his neck.\n\n“Damn it all, he took his own life,” Dotted Line sighed. “He must have known something he didn’t want us torturing out of him.”\n\nBut Sunset had spotted a piece of paper tied to the stallion’s wing. She levitated it to her eyes and began reading. As she read, the unicorn mare began to tremble with rage. Embers flaked off the letter as it vibrated in her magical grip. In a burst of fire the letter was gone and Sunset let the ashes lazily drift to the floor.\n\n“What did it say?” Dotted Line asked.\n\n“Never mind that. Just make sure this doesn’t happen again, or it’ll be your head on the chopping block,” Sunset glared at the stallion. She turned to her two guards and gestured to the hanging pegasus."

Even though they failed to attack Canterlot and were probably being hunted by Daybreaker’s forces at this very moment, these ponies were so... happy. They had little reason to celebrate, but that didn’t stop Starlight from doing whatever she could to boost morale.\n\nVelvet himself stood alone at the edge of the crowd, nursing a drink and trying to ignore the cold mountain air nipping at his coat. It would probably be best for him to join the festivities, to try and ease the suspicions directed at him. But Velvet couldn’t summon the energy to pretend to be happy. His thoughts kept returning to Sparking Flame. The orange unicorn had a family, for Daybreaker’s sake! Why would he just throw his life away like that?\n\nHis eyes caught a flash of movement. Starlight Glimmer had stepped out of the crowd when nopony was looking. As she stepped out of the lamp light, the smile on her face faded. She gave one last look to the ponies before disappearing through the treeline. Velvet raised an eyebrow and stood up to follow her, his drink forgotten.\n\nThe leaves russelled in the wind as Velvet followed the trails left by the unicorn. If he strained his ears, he could almost hear... sobbing? He followed the sound and found Starlight alone, crying on the edge of a riverbank. Velvet didn’t know what possessed him in that moment, but he stepped into the clearing to join her."

She visibly relaxed and allowed a weak smile to appear on her face.\n\n“Oh, it’s you.”\n\n“What’s wrong? You’re missing the party,” Velvet asked. Starlight didn’t reply immediately. She seemed to be debating something inside her head.\n\n“Do you consider me a bad pony?” She spoke after a long silence, glancing at him with a sad look in her eyes.\n\nVelvet raised an eyebrow. “What kind of question is that?”\n\n“Please, Velvet. I need you to be honest with me.”\n\nHis heart clenched painfully. Honest? How could he ever be honest with her? Even now he was callously abusing her trust when she was at her lowest. What would Starlight think if she knew she was exposing her vulnerabilities to a solar spy? But he had to give an answer. Oddly enough, he found the words flowing freely from his mouth. And not a single one was a lie.\n\n“I don’t think you’re a bad pony.”\n\nStarlight turned away, gazing up at the moon hanging low in the sky. “I thought this would be so easy. I thought I could defeat Daybreaker with the power of friendship and everything would go back to normal. Harmony would return to Equestria, and nopony would have to die. But I’ve already gotten so many ponies killed, Velvet. Ponies who trusted me to take Twilight’s place. I’m such a failure!”\n\nShe burst into tears again, burying her face in her forehooves. Velvet reached out to try and console her, but then thought better of it. He stepped back, letting Starlight have her space.\n\n“I-I thought maybe, if I could just reach out to ponies and remind them of what they cherish, then they would lay down their weapons,” Starlight clutched her chest as her body was wracked with sobs. “Twilight made it look so easy. But today I looked into that spy’s eyes and saw the same unyielding determination I see in my own comrades. He genuinely believed in Daybreaker, and nothing I could say would change that. He’s alive, you know.”\n\nStarlight looked up at Velvet, forcing the earth pony to school his face into a mask of apathy. Hearing that Sparking Flame hadn’t died trying to save him... it was like a heavy weight had been lifted from his shoulders."

 paxsolaris.227.d:0 "“He killed two of my guards and fled,” Starlight continued, oblivious to Velvet’s deception. “They had families, Velvet. One had two colts waiting for him back home. Colts that are never going to see their father again because of my decision. No matter what I do, I can’t defeat Daybreaker without standing on a mountain of corpses and broken families. And yet here I am, continuing down this path. Does that make me a bad pony?”\n\n“I don’t know what you expect me to say,” Velvet admitted. “I’m just a codebreaker. I wasn’t hired for my understanding of morality.”\n\nStarlight chuckled lightly, giving him a watery smile.\n\n“But... I don’t think you’re a bad pony. I can’t give you a reason why, but my gut tells me you’re not evil,” He confessed. It took him a while to realise that he hadn’t been lying. There were many ponies in the resistance he hated. But he couldn’t bring himself to hate Starlight. She wasn’t evil, she loved Equestria just as much as he did.\n\nStarlight stood up and wiped the dust from her hooves. “Thanks, Velvet. You should rejoin the others.”\n\nVelvet nodded, taking the opportunity to slip back into the forest. Just as caught sight of the flickering of the firelight through the trees, he felt the hairs at the back of his next stand on end. Slowly he turned and found himself facing a familiar blue mare giving him a sour look.\n\n“Well well well. Out for a stroll, are you?” Trixie Lulamoon smiled, but her eyes were hard and calculating."

She circled around him, twirling the pistol in her magic while he remained rooted to the ground. “One thing show business teaches you is to never trust anypony. I choose to make exceptions for my friends. But you are not one of them.”\n\nShe came face to face with him, pressing the pistol into his neck. Velvet trembled under the predatory stare of those piercing purple eyes.\n\n“Don’t think that just because you beat me to the punch in saving Starlight that I trust you. Starlight may be willing to see the good in anypony. I take a more pessimistic outlook. For whatever reason, she’s decided to trust you. But I swear, if you make her regret that decision I will burn you alive and personally deliver the ashes to Tartarus. Do I make myself clear?”\n\nVelvet gulped, his eyes fixated on the barrel of her gun. He nodded slowly. “Crystal, ma’am.”\n\n“Good. Now, go get drunk with the other stallions. I’ll tend to Starlight.”\n\nShe teleported away, allowing Velvet to breathe again. He rubbed his neck, trying to forget the sensation of cold metal pressed against his jugular. Trixie was far more dangerous than he’d given her credit for. She may be willing to let Starlight take centre stage, but he’d been a fool to disregard her because of it. That was a mistake Velvet would not make again."

The ponies that managed to escape were huddled around fireplaces built under hastily erected tarpaulins that barely did anything to keep out the rain. There were no trees for miles in every direction, just desolate wind-blasted stone. When the storm broke, they would be easy pickings for Daybreaker’s pegasi.\n\n“Well at least we survive to fight another day,” Starlight tried to stay positive, though her expression betrayed her inner grief. She’d left hundreds of her friends for dead during the siege. And they were the lucky ones. The thought of what those psychopaths in the Imperial Royal Guard would do to the survivors sickened Starlight to her stomach. Even Trixie shivered at the thought.\n\n“It was foolish to establish a stronghold so close to Canterlot,” Trixie silently cursed herself to Tartarus and back. “We can’t make the same mistake. I say we flee east to put as much distance between us and Daybreaker as possible. The ponies of the east haven’t given up on harmony yet.”\n\n“And we can contact the foreign nations for support!” Starlight added. “I still have contacts in Griffonia from my socialist days.”\n\n“Yes, that too,” Trixie agreed. She didn’t have it in her to tell Starlight that her friends had likely abandoned her. It would not surprise Trixie if the only aid they received was from nations trying to keep Daybreaker’s gaze directed inwards. It wasn’t like they ever cared before. Why would they start now?\n\nStarlight turned back to the trembling mass of ponies, each trying to leach whatever warmth they could from the fire. A few cried. Others tossed and turn in a restless sleep, their dreams plagued with the memories of friends they would never see again."

They had inflicted heavy losses against the organisation, but the real prize had eluded them. The organisers of the Harmony Restoration Movement were still at large.\n\nAnd now the ball was in their court. The ponies of the east were not nearly as loyal as their cousins in the heartland or frontier. Manehattan had been a hotbed of resistance activity from day one, so Starlight and Trixie would find plenty of supporters to shelter them now that they had gone to ground. It would be challenging to dig them out, even more so now that the high command of the resistance had scattered across the entire east coast. Worse, the foreign nations were beginning to show interest in their plight. Even political support would lend a lot of credence to Harmony Restoration Movement, let alone if the foreign nations managed to sneak supplies and weapons across the solar border.\n\nBut Winter Star was prepared to leave no stone unturned until he found those traitors and dragged them out into the light of the sun to pay for their crimes.

He recognised many of the faces from his last meeting with the representatives of the resistance leaders; but others were missing. Their places in the circle had been left vacant, almost like a tribute to their fallen owners. But Velvet knew what had happened. For the sake of morale, Crimson Nova had tried to silence any talk about the attack on the resistance headquarters. But it was hard to keep a lid on the details with [THIS.GetNameDef] broadcasting the news on every station. At least the weeks of inactivity had helped improve Velvet’s ability to pretend to be upset.\n\nTrixie sat tall and powerful at the centre of the circle, but even Velvet’s untrained eyes could tell the effort was causing her pain. But she refused to show it. As he expected, Starlight was nowhere to be found. It seems the duo would not risk having both of the Harmony Restoration Movement’s leaders in the same place again.\n\n“Are we all here?” Trixie asked. She didn’t wait for an answer before launching on. “Good. I’ll make this quick, I don’t want to give Daybreaker another second of reprieve. Starlight has been negotiating with a few foreign governments and believes they are willing to lend their support to our effort. But first, they need us to prove we are worth supporting.”\n\nAn angry look passed over her face, but it was gone so quickly Velvet suspected he might have imagined it.\n\n“I have faith that we, the Great and Powerful resistance, can meet this challenge. Starlight and I have made plans with the Manehattan cell we believe will guarantee the support of the other nations. But you have an equally important task.

But he needed some time alone to weigh his options.\n\nTrixie’s spies reported that the Imperial Army regularly sends detailed reports on the state of the border to Canterlot via telegraph. The line was patrolled by pegasi scouts, but Crimson Nova was confident the Whinnyapolis cell could wiretap it quickly enough to avoid detection. But that was only the first hurdle. Any data they received would be heavily encoded, so as the only codebreaker in the Whinnyapolis cell it would fall on Velvet’s shoulders to interpret what they received.\n\nThe Inquisition had not yet managed to contact him and reestablish communications in the new location, so it would be impossible to warn them. No matter what he did, Velvet would be receiving classified reports on every Imperial military force in the Severyana region tomorrow morning. If these were leaked to the international world it would allow foreign governments to support the resistance directly via sneaking equipment and ponies across the border.\n\nVelvet only had two options. He could decode the reports accurately, compromising the security of the Severyana border until the Inquisition discovered the leak. Or he could lie about the contents of the report and claim the original intelligence was a false lead designed to fool the resistance once his treachery was discovered.

They acted exactly as I expected them to.”\n\n“But by recognising the Harmony Restoration Movement, Starlight and Trixie have received more legitimacy than any other resistance movement could dream of,” Sunset scowled. “Because of this, they can organise most of if not all of those vile traitors under their leadership.”\n\n“Don’t get me wrong, Sunset, I desire nothing more than to flay each and every one of them alive then move on to their gutless foreign supporters,” Daybreaker consoled, wrapping one of her wings around the yellow unicorn. “The world did not support Starlight and Trixie out of altruism.

Their ragged coats and sunken faces told him they had been through a harrowing ordeal to get here. Even the children clutching their mother’s fur seemed weak and malnourished. No doubt the adults took exception to the idea that a pony like Starlight understood the depths of their pain.\n\nVelvet couldn’t help but feel slightly guilty. [cohesion_event_2_desc] After that, it was no surprise they were resentful towards ponies. But at the same time, he felt slightly angry towards them. Without ponies like Starlight, these buffalo wouldn’t have a hope in Tartarus of winning. They shouldn’t be scorning her when she’d come all this way to help them.\n\n“And you believe you can help us with our plan?” Chief Skycoat asked, bringing Velvet out of his thoughts.\n\n“Most certainly. I had some friends in Manehattan develop a code for us to use and brought along a friend with a background in code breaking,” Starlight motioned to him. “He can encode and decode the messages for you, which will allow you to coordinate the final phase of the plan with the other groups without the Imperial Royal Guard listening in. Isn’t that right, Velvet?”\n\nThe earth pony nodded. “Shouldn’t be too hard, but the code will only hold for a few hours, so you’ll have to move quickly before the Guard discovers your actions.”\n\n“And remember, once you send the messages you need to get moving as soon as possible,” Starlight reminded them. “Daybreaker’s forces can still triangulate your position.”\n\nChief Skycoat nodded."

 paxsolaris.237.t:0 "Choice 4: Ayandi Black Gold"
 paxsolaris.237.d:0 "This plan was deceptively simple. There were half a dozen oil refineries across the state that supplied oil to the entire southwest. The buffalo were planning to destroy them. But to have any chance of winning, they would need to lure the garrisons out of their defensive positions then attack the undefended refineries. And this required communication between the various groups so they could track where the Imperial forces were. The last thing Chief Skycoat wanted was to attack a refinery with the defences still intact.\n\nThe leaders of the various strike teams had learnt some of Starlight’s code. It would be Velvet’s job to receive the messages, quickly decode them, relay the information to Starlight and then reply with whatever message she gave. Truthfully, it required very little in the way of actual code breaking skills since he had the codebook in his hooves. Were it not for the buffalo being technologically backwards, this process could be automated. But years of experience had taught him how to decode messages faster than the average pony, so the job fell to him.\n\nBut now he had to make a decision. This plan had a decent chance of succeeding. If they pulled it off, it would cripple the solar oil supply for months and impact logistics across the entire southwest. Right now, Velvet was alone with a powerful radio. He could send a coded warning to the Inquisition before the attack. It would be almost impossible to trace the leak to him, but the risk was there.\n\nAnd despite himself, he couldn’t help but feel apprehensive about sending thousands of buffalo to their deaths. It was hard not to sympathise with them. If he warned the Inquisition, then the blood of these buffalo would be on his hooves. Wives would be widowed and children left orphaned. But could he really prioritise their lives over the security of his country?"

 paxsolaris.238.d:0 "It was like a scene from Tartarus. Great tongues of fire lashed out from the burning refineries, devouring the fragile prefab buildings and suffocating the stars with noxious black smoke. Velvet’s eyes watered as he peered through the haze, scanning for any sign of the victorious buffalo and trying to ignore the misshapen lumps lying still in the desert sand illuminated by the inferno.\n\nThe buffalo had spared nopony. Guards, engineers, even the workers. It was a massacre, and Velvet had seen it all. The destruction of imperial oil supplies was forgotten to him, because all his mind could do was replay what he’d seen through the binoculars. Those vivid memories of the buffalo gunning down every pony they could find, not sparing a single soul. Merciful Empress, he should have warned the garrisons when he had the chance. He never expected the buffalo would use the advantage he’d given them to enact such a brutal revenge.\n\nHis eyes met Starlight’s and they shared an identical expression of mute horror. She seemed to be pleading with him. For what, he didn’t know. Velvet grabbed every resistance codebook they’d taken with them and dragged Starlight away from the tents."

 paxsolaris.239.d:0 "It was early morning when the buffalo returned. They limped back over the mountain crest, their tired legs carrying them over the final hurdle before they collapsed to the ground. Of the returning buffalo, few of them bore serious wounds. It didn’t take long for Velvet to realise why. To escape the Imperial Royal Guards, they needed to be fast. The wounded would have been left behind to die.\n\nBut it was their faces that told Velvet all he needed to know. Their anger still burned bright, but it had no direction. Rather, it seemed like the buffalo were just angry at fate itself for heaping yet another defeat upon their shoulders. Velvet might have done his duty to Daybreaker, but he couldn’t help but feel bad.\n\nVelvet left with Starlight soon after. Both could sense the anger burning inside their once allies. It wouldn’t be long before the buffalo decided to blame them for the ill-fated attack. Starlight took hold of him and teleported away, leaving the buffalo to pick up the pieces of their ruined home."

There was no time to question these things as Lefty directed him to carefully place the limp body on the upstairs bed so the pegasus could begin tending to her wounds. The minutes ticked by. As Velvet expected, the ‘unicorn’s’ flesh was less responsive than it should be. With Lefty’s frustration growing, the mare slowly regained consciousness.\n\n“W-where am I?” She asked in a weak voice. Her forehooves tensed, but Lefty kept her restrained.\n\n“It’s okay, we’re friends,” Lefty consoled. “Please, I’m going to need you to relax. You’ve been shot. I need to treat your wound.”\n\n“No, it’s fine. I can-”\n\n“Enough of this!” Velvet interrupted. “My friend is trying to help you. So why don’t you drop that disguise and make it easier for him?”\n\nThe mare flinched at his voice. Slowly, she nodded, and her form was engulfed by green fire. When it faded away, her lilac coat was gone, replaced by a hard chitin exoskeleton.\n\n“You’re a changeling!” Lefty exclaimed, instinctively flinching back.\n\n“No, please! I... my name is Cephoidea,” The changeling pleaded. “I’m with Thorax! He wanted me to find the leaders of the Harmony Restoration Movement and offer them support. Your comrades in Vanhoover told me this was a safe house and I- ah!” She flinched as her movements aggravated the wound.\n\n“Damn it, you’re still hurt,” Lefty cursed, forgetting his earlier hostility. “Velvet, get me some hot water. I need to clean-” He was interrupted by a knocking on the door.\n\nCephoidea twitched, her chitin somehow growing pale. “It’s the Inquisition! I’m so sorry, I thought I lost them!”\n\n“Shush, it’s fine,” Lefty consoled. He turned to Velvet. “Can you talk to them? Please, I don’t think she can move and-”\n\n“It’s fine,” Velvet interrupted. He quickly raced down the stairs as the knocking grew harder. Finally, he opened the door and found himself staring into the piercing green eyes of a familiar orange unicorn."

A changeling? Here? Well I can’t say I know anything but I’ll be happy to help in any way I can,” Velvet raised his voice enough for Lefty to hear, briefly glancing upwards to let Sparking know there were others in the safehouse.\n\nThe unicorn gave a slow nod. “I appreciate the hospitality. Would you mind stepping outside for questioning?”\n\nThe door creaked shut behind him as Velvet stepped out into the frigid night air. Once they were out of earshot, the unicorn turned to Velvet and gave him a piercing stare. “So, is the changeling in there?”\n\nVelvet nodded. “She collapsed at our doorstep with a bullet in her torso. Your handywork, I presume?”\n\nSparking nodded, giving Velvet a rare smile. “You would be correct.”\n\n“Why is she so important? She mentioned something about working for Thorax?” Velvet asked. He had of course heard of the changeling defector. S.M.I.L.E owed much of their understanding of the changeling language to him.\n\n“She wasn’t lying,” Sparking replied. “We captured a few of her allies in Vanhoover and they gave her up. It was decided to make capturing or killing her a priority, but I’ll hold off for now to preserve your cover. Just send her to the Shire safe house. We’ve got that place monitored.”\n\n“Shire? That’s back the way she came. If send her there and you capture her, it won’t look good for me.”\n\n“Sorry, but capturing the changeling is a priority and Shire is the only city that guarantees success.”\n\n“Look, I’ve already made a lot of risks here. Starlight has me managing the underground communication networks of the entire frontier. If I get outed as a spy, she’ll scrub every safe houses as a precaution, even if I never learnt their exact location.”\n\n“Perhaps you’re right,” Sparking sighed. “But high command isn’t going to like it.

Come back if you every get shot again,” Lefty winked, making the changeling giggle.\n\n“With an invitation like that, how could I refuse?”\n\nVelvet watched the two interact with a silent detachment. It was hard to maintain a happy smile when his mind was at war with itself. Had he done the right thing? Sure, his position in the resistance was important. But was it important enough to let the changelings establish ties with the Harmony Restoration Movement? Even with the new changeling detection technologies, it could prove difficult for the Inquisition to deal with shapeshifting armies.\n\nCephoidea kissed Lefty’s cheek and closed the door behind her, leaving the two stallions alone in the safehouse.

That was worse.\n\n“I hope you reach Shire safely,” Lefty said, helping the changeling with her saddlebags. He gave Velvet an unreadable look over her shoulder.\n\n“I’m sure I’ll be fine. Velvet is right. The last thing the Inquisition would expect me to do is double back.”\n\n“Yeah... I’m sure you’ll be fine,” Lefty said, but he didn’t seem to believe his own words.\n\nCephoidea kissed Lefty’s cheek and closed the door behind her, leaving the two stallions alone in the safehouse.

You reek of shame and treachery. Until you prove yourself by spilling the blood of a solar heretic, you are of no use to me.”\n\nA trickle of fear ran down Velvet’s spine. The thestral tribes of the south possessed ancient magic even the mages of Canterlot could only guess at. Did they somehow know he was a spy? The thought made his heart skip a beat.\n\n“Look, I didn’t come all this way just to be-” He began, but his words were silenced by two of the chief’s guards pressing bayonets to his neck.\n\n“I don’t care,” Orchid Light replied. “You’re lucky I don’t just kill you now. I’m sure I could make up something about an Inquisitorial task force to satisfy Starlight. Unless you want me to send you back to Manehattan in pieces, you will do as I say.”\n\nVelvet glared at the thestral, but his shaking knees betrayed his fear. With no other option, he nodded.\n\n“I knew we could come to an arrangement,” Orchid Light waved his hoof, prompting his guards to stand down and let Velvet breath again. “Our Moonspeakers tell of a great evil that stalks these jungles. Slaves of the sun’s light more fanatical than any before. They hold an ancient moonstone sacred to Nightmare Moon in a base in the mountains east of here. You will recover it for us.”\n\n“You expect me to break into a fortified base by myself!?”\n\n“No, I expect you to die. But if you come back with the moonstone, I will be pleasantly surprised. I’d like to remind you that you don’t really have a choice.”\n\nVelvet closed his eyes and took a deep, shuddering breath to steady his nerves.

 paxsolaris.245.d:0 "This couldn’t be right. The thestrals said this bunker was home to dozens of solar cultists. Yet it was empty and looked like it had been for centuries. The concrete was cracked and covered in slimy moss. Parts of the roof had caved in, letting sunlight flood the interior. Hoof-high puddles of putrid water covered the floor. This place felt... wrong. Like it shouldn’t be here. Strange images flickered in the corner of his eye, but they were gone before Velvet could focus on them. With his heart hammering in his chest, Velvet stepped forward and found himself standing before a hoof-sized white object resting on a pedestal, surrounded by empty crates and dust. It was the moonstone. But why would the cultists leave behind a priceless magical-\n\n“Greetings, Velvet,” A voice interrupted his thoughts.\n\nVelvet spun around and found himself facing a blue unicorn stallion dressed in a white and gold robe. He tried to speak, but terror sucked the words from his mouth.\n\n“W-who are you?” Velvet managed to stutter. He could have sworn the room had had been empty when he stepped in.\n\n“That’s not important. What’s important is who you are. Velvet Arrow, friend of Starlight Glimmer and spy for the Imperial Inquisition.”\n\nVelvet fumbled through his saddle bags and produced a pistol, aiming it at the unicorn’s head. “How do you know that!? Answer me or I’ll blow your damn head off!”\n\n“Please, there is no need for that,” The unicorn ignited his horn, levitating the moonstone into Velvet’s saddlebag. “Just take the moonstone back to the thestrals. Let them use its magic to plague the dreams of ponies with nightmares. It will only make the retribution that comes to them that much worse.”\n\n“That still doesn’t answer my-” Velvet began, but in the blink of the eye the unicorn was gone. There was no flash of teleportation. He just disappeared, like he’d never existed at all.\n\nNow alone, Velvet weighed his options. That... hallucination(?)... had given him the moonstone. He could return to Ayacachtli before the sun set, completing his mission in record time. And yet, a part of him was terrified about carrying out the final order of an apparition.

His eyes were unfocused, staring off into space. He didn’t react as the thestral chief stood up from his throne to address his gathered subjects.\n\n“My friends! Today, we have recovered yet another piece of our glorious heritage stolen from us by the loathsome solarists! With this artefact, we will channel the power of the night goddess and plague the dreams of our enemies with nightmares most foul!

Don’t worry Velvet, you are not to blame. Did you at least recover anything useful?”\n\n“Nope,” Velvet answered far too quickly. Starlight shot him a suspicious glance but didn’t comment. That was probably for the best. He didn’t plan on telling her how he’d offloaded the moonstone to the first Inquisition outpost he found.

As the resistance had grown, Velvet had taken on the role of liaison between Crimson Nova and the entire Bales-Whinnyapolis region, coding orders to be sent out and decoding what came back... but he’d never received something like this. These were reconnaissance reports, which in itself wasn’t unusual. It was the sheer number that gave him pause. Dozens of reports on bridges, railways and roads bordering the eastern seaboard.\n\nHe tore the last decoded copy from the typewriter and stepped away from his desk. Perhaps he’d risk asking the pegaus himself? Velvet stepped into the small office, not bothering to knock. But instead of Crimson Nova, he found himself staring at a pink unicorn.\n\n“Velvet!” Starlight greeted him with a warm smile. “I didn’t expect you.”\n\n“Sorry, I had no idea you were here,” Velvet hastily apologised. “Crimson Nova doesn’t like knocking. He says it wastes valuable time. Where is he, by the way?”\n\n“He’s out checking our warehouse stock for a plan of mine. You can report what you have straight to me.”\n\n“It’s nothing special. I’ve just finished decoding the reconnaissance reports,” Velvet replied, placing down the typed copies on Starlight’s desk. She rifled through them, growing more excited with every sheet.\n\n“‘Nothing special’ indeed,” Starlight grinned. “These are very important documents, Velvet. They’re key to the final stages of our efforts against Daybreaker. Now normally, you’d be hearing this from Crimson. But I’ll tell you in person. After all, we’re friends.”\n\n“We are?” Velvet asked. He’d never thought about it before. Sure, Starlight was nice. And sure, he enjoyed his brief moments around her.\n\n“Of course! You did save my life, after all. Don’t you think that makes us friends?”\n\n“Yeah, I suppose that does,” He replied, feeling his heart clench in his chest. Some friend he’d been, abusing Starlight’s trust at every opportunity. If he was Starlight’s friend, he must be the worst friend in Equestria.\n\n“Anyway, I’ve devised a plan with Trixie that will give the resistance a much-needed advantage in the east,” Starlight continued, oblivious to Velvet’s inner thoughts. “We’re going to destroy all major roads and railways leading to the eastern seaboard.”"

If this plan works, the supplies Daybreaker sends to the east coast will slow to a trickle and we’ll finally be able to come out of the shadows and fight her directly.”\n\nVelvet took a second to try and steady his nerves. This was big. Far bigger than anything the resistance had attempted before. Even the attack on Canterlot had been nothing compared to this.\n\n“And what would you have me do?”\n\n“You’ll be in charge of coordinating the strike teams along the Manesbury River via radio. If all goes according to plan, the bridges spanning the river should be rubble before the Inquisition manages to triangulate your position.”\n\nOkay, this was fine. He could still get a warning out to the Inquisition before the attack.\n\n“By the way, you should meet Crimson Nova outside. The strike teams are moving out in a few hours.”\n\nVelvet silently cursed, but he managed to force a determined look on his face. “I understand, Starlight.”\n\nHe gave a quick salute and turned to leave, his mind already whirling with plans. There was no time to use the radio he’d stashed in the forest. He’d need to contact the Inquisition another way.

Velvet didn’t want to spend another moment waiting on this dirty sidewalk to be taken back to the Whinnyapolis base. As the car pulled up, Velvet moved to open the back door only for pink telekinetic aura to fling it open. A blue unicorn was waiting inside, fixing him with a piercing stare.\n\n“We need to talk,” Trixie Lulamoon said.\n\nGulping nervously, Velvet climbed into the car and took a seat next to the mare. She remained silent as the driver took off, taking them far outside the city limits. Only when they were on the highway did she speak again. \n\n“I’ve been keeping tabs on you, Velvet Arrow. And I’ve noticed a certain trend. It seems that any plans we make involving you have a habit of failing. Care to comment?”\n\nVelvet’s heart froze and his blood turned icy. But he schooled his face into a mask of neutrality and managed to force his mouth to speak.\n\n“I’m sorry, I guess I’ve just been unlucky.”\n\nTrixie’s violet eyes watched him like a hawk watching its prey. “If you’re a spy, you’re a smart one. The Inquisition has seized every record they could get their grubby hooves on and you have yet to screw up enough to truly damn yourself, so I can’t take action. Yet. But I’ll be watching you, Velvet Arrow. If you don’t fix these ‘unlucky accidents’...”\n\nVelvet flinched back as the unicorn’s horn ignited, producing a thin blade of pure magic under his throat."

 paxsolaris.255.d:0 "“Commander Glimmer, you wanted to see me?” Velvet approached the mare, giving her a quick salute.\n\nShe arrived unannounced at the new Whinnyapolis base for a meeting with Crimson Nova, but Velvet thought she would’ve teleported away by now. Not be sitting alone in the cramped office space while the others had dinner downstairs.\n\n“Please, Starlight is fine,” The unicorn replied. She levitated a small plate of baked beans in his nose. “I was hoping you would join me for dinner. It’s not much, but I wanted to thank you again for saving my life.”\n\nVelvet took a seat next to the unicorn and accepted the plate with a smile. “You know, you don’t need to thank me. I was just in the right place at the right time.”\n\n“That does not diminish your act. You thought I was about to be killed and your first instinct was to save me. That tells me you’re a good pony.”\n\nThe earth pony heaved a bitter sigh. “If you knew half the things I’ve done, you wouldn’t think so.”\n\n“I’m hardly in any position to judge a pony for their past,” Starlight countered. “Nothing you’ve done could compare to the sins I’ve committed. I don’t deserve to be leading the resistance. But if not me, who? Luna, Twilight, the Element Bearers... they’re all gone.”\n\n“What about Commander Lulamoon?”\n\nStarlight smiled at the mention of the showmare. “Trixie is the best friend I could ask for. I would trust the world to her. But while Trixie may not like Daybreaker, she’s not wholly opposed to her. She only joined the resistance because she knew how important it was to me. I know that if I died, Trixie would take over. But she would be doing it for me, not because she wanted to.”\n\n“Well that settles it then. You’re not the same mare you once were. You’ve gone from brainwashed ponies to refusing to make a friend do something she doesn’t want to do, even if she would carry out your orders without hesitation. You’ve changed.”\n\n‘Unlike me,’ Velvet thought. A moment of silence passed, with Starlight giving him an unreadable expression. Slowly, a smile formed on her face."

These lines had been burned in her memory from dozens of reads, yet Starlight was no closer to figuring out why these plans had failed. She ran a hoof through her mane, ignoring the clumps of hair that came away with it.\n\n“We have another traitor on our hooves,” Trixie replied, carefully sipping from a porcelain teacup.\n\n“Yes, but who? I’ve cross-referenced the ponies from each of the plans and I can’t find a single lead,” Starlight sighed, cradling her head in her hooves. Why was this so hard? She just wanted to do the right thing. But it seemed like the universe was hellbent on stopping her every step of the way.\n\n“How about Velvet Arrow?” Trixie proposed. “He’s been involved in-“\n\n“No!” Starlight cut her off. “He saved my life! He wouldn’t do that!” She turned away, her voice falling to a whisper. “...He wouldn’t do that.”\n\n“You’re putting the entire resistance at stake because you can’t see what’s in front of you!” Trixie shot back.\n\n“Like you care!” Starlight spat, standing up baring her teeth to the blue unicorn. “We both know you’re a Daybreaker sympathiser! Maybe the real traitor is YOU!”\n\nTrixie gasped in shock, the teacup falling from her telekinetic grip. “HOW DARE YOU! I didn’t have to help you with this band of dissidents! I did anyway, because that’s what friends do. But if you’re too blind to see that, perhaps I should leave!”\n\n“No, Trixie. I-” Starlight bowed her head, feeling tears well up in her eyes. “I’m sorry. You’ve always been there for me. I’m just so confused and I’m sorry for lashing out. Stay. Please, I... I need you.”\n\nAs Starlight began to sob, Trixie closed the distance between them and pulled her friend into a hug, gently rubbing her back."

The earth pony paid it no mind, waiting for the rum in his glass to settle again before taking another swig. Outside, the sounds of gunfire were growing louder, but Velvet couldn’t summon the energy to move. All he wanted was to enjoy this moment of respite, however long it may last.\n\n“You’re a hard stallion to pin down, Velvet,” A voice broke the silence of the abandoned bar. Velvet didn’t look up as an orange unicorn took a seat next to him, levitating another bottle from behind the counter and pouring himself a drink.\n\n“You arranged this meeting,” Velvet reminded the unicorn.\n\n“So I did,” Sparking Flame chuckled to himself, taking a long sip from his glass. He levitated a manilla folder and placed it in front of Velvet. “This is your new assignment. If you do this right, you’ll get to go home.”\n\n“I don’t have a home to go back to,” Velvet mumbled, but he accepted the folder and flipped through it, his heart clenching tightly as he read what was inside. Of course. Velvet had been expecting this assignment for some time now, but now that it had finally arrived he couldn’t help but feel apprehensive.\n\n“There’s a strike team on standby in the city,” Sparking explained. “Our orders are to capture them both alive if possible so that they can be interrogated, but it’s your job to lead them into the Manehattan Underground.”\n\nVelvet’s hooves trembled slightly. He took hold of his glass and sculled the contents as if it could drown out the feelings inside him."

He just couldn’t get over the joy on Starlight’s face when she saw he was alive. How quickly would it take that joy to turn into hatred?\n\n“You’re just in time. We’re preparing evacuation of the city. I... it’s bad, Velvet. The Imperial Army has got the city surrounded and I don’t have the magic to teleport everyone out. Trixie came up with the idea of hijacking a ship and escaping via the sea, but the Imperial Navy rests at anchor outside the harbour. It will be risky.”\n\nVelvet took a few deep breaths to steady his nerves. This was his duty. This was what the Empress demanded of him.\n\n“What about the Underground?” He suggested. “The Imperial Army hasn’t taken it yet. If we’re quick, we could follow the tunnels and head north to Prance.”\n\nStarlight shared a wordless conversation with Trixie, who slowly nodded.\n\n“I prefer my plan,” The former magician stated. “But I trust your judgement, Starlight.”\n\n“Okay then,” She turned back to Velvet. “I want you to hear your opinion. Whatever you decide, we’ll do. Please, think carefully about this.”\n\nVelvet opened his mouth to reply, then hesitated. He made the mistake of looking into Starlight’s eyes and felt guilt clench his heart. But there was something else in those eyes. A promise of another option, if he was brave enough to take it. It was time to stop lying to himself. Velvet had never believed in Daybreaker’s cause. He’d worked with the Inquisition out of fear, but Starlight was giving him the chance to wash his hands of the past. All he had to do was take it."

There’s an old maintenance tunnel under this building,” Trixie told them. “I made sure we of it when we purchased this place.”\n\n“If either you still have magic left, we should take point,” Velvet suggested. “We can teleport back and warn the others if we encounter trouble.”\n\n“Excellent idea,” Starlight nodded. “I’ll order everyone to pack what they can and be prepared to follow us.”\n\nThe two mares began issuing orders to the assembled resistance agents while Velvet waited in silence. This came so naturally to them. It was no coincidence they had risen to the forefront of the struggle against Daybreaker. But it was Velvet who took the lead, guiding the two unicorns to basement of the building, their hoofsteps echoing off the concrete.\n\nEventually the stairs gave way to a large tunnel, stretching off to either side of them until it was lost in the dark gloom. Starlight pointed to their right. “This is leads north. We’ve got a few dozen kilometres to go before reaching the tunnel exit at the city limits.”\n\nSilence descended upon the trio, broken only by the shuddering of explosions far above them. Bits of dust rained down upon them, but the concrete of the tunnels held strong. But as the minutes ticked by, they became aware of a dull whistling noise.\n\n“Do you hear that?” Trixie asked. Starlight paused her steps, listening intently as the noise grew louder.\n\nNeither of the mares had time to react when a team of pegasi barrelled into the mares, tackling them to the ground and fastening magic suppressors to their horns before they could strike back. An orange flash illuminated the room as Sparking Flame teleported in, quickly checking that the magic suppressors were fastened correctly before approaching Velvet."

She didn’t even stir as the guards hoisted her back to her hooves.\n\n“Why?” She whispered, her voice soft and lifeless. “Why did you do this to me? I thought we were friends. I... I thought you cared about me...”\n\nVelvet turned away, unable to meet Starlight’s mournful gaze. As inquisitors led her away, Velvet swore he could hear the unicorn start to cry.\n\n“I’ll make sure these two don’t escape,” Sparking told him. “You coming, Velvet?”\n\n“In a moment.

He gestured to the two bound mares. “We had them both in suppressors before either could cast a spell.”\n\nTrixie sent him a hateful glare, struggling in vain against the shackles binding her hooves together while Starlight continued to stare off into space.\n\n“Excellent work, inquisitor. I’ll be sure to mention you in my report,” Sunset replied. For once, she seemed somewhat genuine. “Perhaps a promotion is in order for you. Your talents would be a fine addition to the Guard. As for the prisoners, the Empress wants them alive. What we interrogate out of them could break the resistance. Permanently.”\n\n“And I trust that’s why you’re here, to take them with you?” Sparking raised an eyebrow. The Imperial Royal Guard were famous for their interrogation techniques. He’d even heard rumours of them using black magic to interrogate the dead.\n\nSunset’s expression hardened into a glare. “Regrettably, no. The Empress doesn’t want them held in the same facility. The Inquisition will take Trixie, but Starlight is mine.”\n\nTwo royal guards stepped out from behind their leader. They forced Starlight to her hooves and teleported away, taking the resistance leader with them.\n\n“Until we meet again, Sparking Flame,” Sunset nodded. She followed her soldiers, teleporting away and leaving the agent alone with the pegasi inquisitors and one blue unicorn.\n\nNow that Sunset was gone, Sparking Flame let a wide grin appear on his face. They’d done it. They’d captured the leaders of the resistance and struck a blow the Harmony Restoration Movement could not possibly recover from. He stepped out into the early morning sun, feeling its warm rays on his coat; it was like her majesty was smiling at him.

All those friends she’d made, never to be seen again.\n\nAfter all, nobody had ever escaped the Ruby Mountain Citadel.\n\nBuilt as a monument to Daybreaker’s power, the Citadel was well hidden in the mountain ranges, only visible from an uninhabited rocky valley. To most Equestrians, it was little more than a bad rumour. Starlight knew better. She knew many of her comrades had been sent here and never again seen the light of day.\n\nThe concrete fortress cast long shadows over the mare as he was led into its maw. As the engine of the truck fell silent, two Imperial Royal Guards unlocked her cage and led Starlight out into the loading bay. A familiar yellow unicorn was waiting for her, a smug grin on her face.\n\n“Ah, Starlight Glimmer,” Sunset smiled. “How kind of you to pay a visit to my humble abode. I trust the journey didn’t give you much trouble?”\n\n“Go to Tartarus,” Starlight bared her teeth to the mare. It was the only form of resistance she could offer. Sunset just shrugged and gestured to one of the guards.\n\n“Secure her for transportation into the lower levels.”\n\nThe guards nodded threw Starlight to the ground. Just as she tried to stand up, invisible ropes forced her back against the cold concrete. Sunset Shimmer loomed over her, examining the unicorn like she was a specimen to dissect. A strange magic pressed against Starlight’s skull, breaking through her mental barriers and assaulting her mind directly.\n\n“Get some rest. We have a long day tomorrow.”"

Why does a servant of Daybreaker want to speak with me?”\n\nThe stallion’s gaze faltered. He broke eye contact, glancing nervously at his hooves. “Look, I know you have little reason to trust me. I’m only here out of desperation. I... I found something in the Inquisitorial archives. Please, you’re the only pony I can turn to. If Sunset Shimmer finds out what I’ve done-”\n\n“It’s alright,” Starlight interrupted the stallion’s panic attack. “We’ll make sure Shimmer doesn’t find you. Is the folder we found on you the one from the archives?”\n\nSeeing the stallion nod, Starlight levitated the folder to the steel interrogation table and began to read. It was a standard Inquisitorial report, detailing an investigation carried out into resistance activity in the southeast. But as Starlight read further, the gentle smile on her face began to fade, replaced with mounting horror. Words jumped out at her. Massacre. Atrocity. An entire town of ponies dragged from their homes by faceless Imperial Royal Guards and executed in the forest, their bodies filling a freshly dug mass grave.

My inquisitors photographed them both hiding out in an abandoned warehouse east of the river, likely to coordinate the next phase of their operation without the risk of spies or inquisitors listening in. That means we only have a brief window to capture them both.”\n\nSunset glared at her once-friend. She didn’t trust the new Grand Inquisitor in the slightest. Twilight Sparkle may play the part of an inquisitor, but Sunset knew she still harboured treasonous thoughts in her heart. If only Daybreaker could put aside her limitless mercy and compassion and see what Sunset saw, maybe she would realise that she didn’t need Twilight. All she needed was her.\n\n“The Imperial Royal Guards stand ready to strike, my empress,” Sunset added. “I will personally make sure both Starlight and Trixie are dead or captured by the week’s end.”\n\n“Sunset is right,” Twilight agreed, acknowledging the yellow unicorn with a nod. “We need quick and decisive action before they can slip away again.”\n\nThe field marshal ground her teeth together. Twilight was in no position to patronise her.\n\n“You have both done excellent work,” Daybreaker spoke up. She stepped forward, effortlessly passing through the wall of fire. “And you are right, we cannot afford to waste any more time on these rabble rousers while the enemies of Equestria plot our demise.”\n\nHer horn flashed crimson and a titanic golden war hammer materialised above her, held in place by a telekinetic aura."

The pony standing guard didn’t have time to react before the mass of twisted metal slammed him to the ground. His comrades cried out in horror as an alicorn stepped into the warehouse, shining brighter than sun she commanded.\n\n“What is it they say?” Daybreaker mused, watching in amusement as the partisans raised their rifles only for tongues of plasma to reduce them to ash. “If you want a job done right, you should do it yourself.”\n\n“Oh Tartarus, it’s her!” One mare cried out just before a crimson aura crushed her windpipe and left her dying on the cold concrete. A thin beam of light swept across the room, slicing cleanly through three more ponies as Imperial forces funnelled in behind Daybreaker.\n\n“Secure the upper levels,” She ordered, conjuring up a shield just in time to deflect a hail of bullets. Two Royal Guards returned fire, gunning down a group of pegasi attempting to flee.\n\nDaybreaker swept through the building like a demon of Tartarus, her magic vaporising flesh and concrete alike. It was all too easy for her to exterminate this rabble. One particularly brave pony growled and charged forward, shouting to his comrades. “Come on! Stand and fight!”\n\n“Are you kidding me? We can’t fight that!” Another shouted as magic lifted him up into the air and ripped his body to ribbons. The sight of the bloody mess falling to the ground was the final nail in the coffin. One by one, the partisans broke rank, screaming as bullets and plasma zipped past them. Daybreaker paid the retreating ponies no mind. She only regretted not getting to see the despair on their faces when they discovered the warehouse was surrounded by an impenetrable magical shield. Twilight and Sunset would make sure none of them escaped.\n\nAs Daybreaker took another step forward, a beam of cyan magic shot out of the darkness and sent the alicorn stumbling backwards. The solar empress turned to the source, her burning eyes flashing with anticipation."

And then there will be nothing standing in my way.”\n\n“You’re a fool if you think we will submit that easily,” Starlight taunted. “Others will take my place. You can destroy nations, but you’ll never destroy ponykind’s desire to be free. Trust me, I’ve tried.”\n\n“Ah, the delusions of the desperate. You two have made yourselves the lynchpins of the dwindling fraction of ponies who still believe in the lies of the old world. They will be headless without you,” Daybreaker gave Starlight a smug grin. “And I think you know that.”\n\nStarlight lunged forward, trying to catch Daybreaker off guard. The imperial soldiers were forced to leap for cover as her magic tore through the air, but Daybreaker simply deflected the attack with a shield and dashed forward, swinging her war hammer at the mare. Starlight teleported to safety and tore the bricks from the walls of the warehouse. The ground trembled as the ceiling gave way, only for a crimson aura to take hold of the debris and throw them aside.\n\nDaybreaker leapt forward, but Starlight met her with another beam of cyan light, forcing the alicorn to conjure a shield. Starlight gritted her teeth and advanced, the sheer force of her magic causing Daybreaker to slide backwards across the concrete. The air hummed with power as the unicorn poured everything into cracking that shield. The alicorn just smirked, seemingly amused by her efforts.\n\nSuddenly Starlight felt her forehooves be yanked out from under her. She fell forward, her face hitting the hard concrete and breaking her concentration. The magical aura tugged Starlight upwards then slammed her back into the concrete, knocking the mare unconscious. Daybreaker held up the limp unicorn, a triumphant grin on her face."

 paxsolaris.277.d:0 "Daybreaker stood in the centre of the room, glancing around the warehouse for any sign of the blue unicorn. She closed her eyes and focused on her magic, feeling the subtle ebbs and flows of the life around her. There was a bright aura just in front of her, cowering behind a crate.\n\n“There you are.”\n\nJust as she approached the crate, something exploded against her face, sending pain arching through her spine. The aura shimmered out of existence, revealing another aura just to Daybreaker’s left. She opened her eyes and found Trixie waiting for her, a magical anti-material rifle clutched in her hooves.\n\n“Illusion magic. Very clever,” Daybreaker taunted. “You almost got me.”\n\nTrixie snarled and squeezed the trigger again, but a shield shimmering into existence to deflect the shot. Daybreaker trotted forward, her shield flickering with each blocked attack. When the rifle crystals dimmed, Trixie threw it aside and charged forward.\n\n“Just die already!”\n\nCrimson magic took hold of Trixie and assaulted her body, pressing against her brain. Her eyes rolled back and Trixie went limp, joining Starlight in the realm of unconsciousness. Daybreaker tossed both mares at the waiting group of soldiers.\n\n“Get them both in magical restraints. After that, take Starlight to the Citadel and Trixie to Inquisition HQ.”\n\nDaybreaker watched as her soldiers scrambled to obey her orders, quickly fastening suppressors to the horns of the two unicorn mares. She stepped forward, but a flash of pain on her cheek gave her pause. Curious, Daybreaker ran a hoof along the offending spot, feeling a thin trail of blood running down her face. She raised an eyebrow. Had Trixie’s attack... injured her?\n\nThe alicorn shook her head to banish those thoughts. She had scored a tremendous victory today, there was no need to sour it with such musings. This was a day the Harmony Restoration Movement would never recover from. The future of ponykind was now hers to write!"

Their actions have thus far been minor, but many fear this could be the beginning of an insurrection if we don’t act quickly."
 paxsolaris.278.d_1:0 "The discontent with Daybreaker’s rule has reached new levels as more and more ponies have become dissatisfied with the authoritarian polices of the new order. Inquisitors report that many have begun listening to broadcasts from the Harmony Restoration Movement, seeking comfort and purpose in the memories of the old system. Hooligans have spray painted symbols of the organisation on doors and windows while other ponies have begun taking pot shots at police officers and imperial buildings."
 paxsolaris.278.d_2:0 "Another street war has erupted today as H.R.M. partisans assaulted an armoured convoy carrying explosives and firearms to an imperial garrison. A dozen ponies have already died, with the survivors being forced into a hasty retreat. By the time the Imperial Army arrived, the guerrilla fighters had made off with enough weapons and ammunition to arm their efforts for months to come."
 paxsolaris.278.d_3:0 "Terror in the streets today as news of a brutal reprisal attack carried out by Imperial soldiers reached the public ahead of our censors. Acting without orders, a hoofful of drunk reprobates decided to do what they though the local commander didn’t have the guts to and torch an apartment they were convinced harmonist partisans were operating from. The building was quickly consumed by the blaze, along with the homes and lives of over a dozen ponies.\n\nFurious mobs have formed, calling out for the blood of the perpetrators. While the local garrisons struggle to talk down the mob, vigilantes have taken the law into their own hooves and have reportedly begun lynching any loyalists unlucky enough to be caught alone, even going as far as to drag bureaucrats and off-duty soldiers from their homes to be beaten in the streets. Even the news that the soldiers responsible for the attack were due to spend the rest of their lives in a labour camp did little to pacify the mob."
 paxsolaris.278.d_4:0 "An alarming report has arrived in Canterlot, telling of the dismal state of imperial control over Equestria. In many places across the nation, resistance movements rapidly grow from a handful of malcontents to wide-spread insurgencies a thousand ponies strong.

If she accepted this power, all her dreams could become reality.\n\nWith that thought, the princess brought her wrath to heel. She may have the power to incinerate her enemies, but at what cost?

She could hear a deafening roar as the fire greedily sucked oxygen to fuel its might, lifting the alicorn into the air. Unable to contain herself, Celestia began to laugh. Never had she felt such a strong connection to the sun. She could feel its fury. Taste its power. Everything made sense now. There was no friendship without strength. No peace without war. No harmony without order. Yes, this was Celestia’s destiny! To wield the power of the sun and bring destruction upon all those who dared to harm her precious children!\n\nAs the princess accepted her fate, the inferno doubled in strength, shining brighter than anything had ever shone before. Such power did not deserve to be wielded by a weak creature like Celestia. With this silent command, the flames within the alicorn’s heart shot outwards, responding to the will of their goddess and transforming her body. Her bones grew and hardened, her blood and was replaced by pure crimson magic and the colour was scoured from her hair, leaving only purifying fire.\n\nThe energy exploded outwards, vaporising the lingering vestiges of Celestia and painting the floor a sooty black. When the light faded, the peaceful matron of Equestria was gone. In her place was a towering being of radiance and power, hovering in the air as the last of the crimson energy danced around her limbs. As Daybreaker touched down, she opened her burning eyes and began to cackle madly as she felt the world itself quake with fear. She had never felt more alive!\n\nDaybreaker reached out with her magic, grabbing the twisted and molten remnants of her diadem and shaping it into a jagged crown deserving of a goddess made flesh. For a brief moment, the world was still. Ponies, Griffons and Zebras alike were compelled into silence as Daybreaker roared her triumph to the heavens. She seized the sun and thrust it high into the heavens, bathing the world with a harsh light. It was a few minutes early, but the alicorn didn’t care.

She studied the grey marks blighting the map of her nation with a piercing glare. Hate was not a new feeling to the alicorn. She had been burdened with that emotion many times in her long life, but Celestia had never felt such a powerful, virulent hatred as she did in this moment.\n\nAs the war worsened, she had thrown herself into her work. Even as the stress took its toll on her body, Celestia refused to let up because the moment she was left alone to think her mind would go to a dark place. She imagined the glory ponykind could achieve under her guiding radiance. She imagined all the indolent parasites that infested Equestria falling before her like chaff to a scythe.

She studied the nations surrounding her nation as one would a particularly loathsome vermin. Hate was not a new feeling to the alicorn. She had struggled with it many times in her long, immortal life. Yet Celestia had never felt such a powerful, virulent hatred as she did in this moment.\n\nFor a thousand years, Celestia had carefully planned her nation’s future down to the slightest detail. Twilight had acted exactly as the princess predicted and spread friendship across the world in the process. How foolish she was to forget that friendship was not always reciprocated. Now her dreams of utopia had been replaced by visions of a cruel future where ponykind would suffer and die all because of Celestia’s mistake.\n\nThese thoughts weighed heavily on her mind. Had she been stronger and less willing to sacrifice ponykind’s safety in the hope that others would accept peace, her subjects would not be looking down the barrel of subjugation. They could have achieved so much more had she not forced them down this doomed path. These were no idle fantasies.

After being forced to endure the horrors of civil war twice at the hooves of that alicorn, the last spark of sisterly affection in her heart had been snuffed out. Celestia could see no future in forgiving Luna a second time. When they next met, it would end with one of them dead by the other’s hoof.\n\nNo, her grief was for all the ponies slain in Luna’s petulant temper tantrum. They were the real victims in this war. With each atrocity committed by those thestral vermin, Celestia felt her heart break just a little bit more. Worse still was the knowledge that she had allowed these events to come to pass. Her own negligence and trusting nature had made her just as responsible for these deaths as Luna. For that, she hated her sister all the more. Never had she felt such hatred for another being. Not Discord, not Sombra, not even Tirek. The hatred she felt for her own flesh and blood eclipsed it all.\n\nCelestia gripped the moon with her magic and tried to force it beneath the horizon. It resisted her efforts, fighting valiantly to stay in the sky as Nightmare Moon poured more power into it. Celestia could feel the magic of her rival tearing at her horn, but she channelled her rage and struck back, sending waves of hatred through their magical bond.

With the demon distracted, Celestia was free to cast the moon out of the sky and bring the sun over Equestria.\n\nYet the power she used to overwhelm her sister didn’t disappear.

My employer will be with you shortly.” A unicorn butler bowed politely to the two thestrals and hurried away.\n\n“Nice place, eh Silver?” Mist Glade grinned at his brother, running his hooves along the polished wooden chairs. When they’d agreed to meet this mysterious benefactor, Mist Glade had been expecting to arrive at some shady bar, not a manor that would put the towers of Canterlot to shame.\n\nSilver Glade didn’t share his brother’s enthusiasm. “Don’t get too comfortable. These arms dealers are not to be trusted. Did you see how many guards they had around this place? Nopony has this much security unless they’re involved in something seriously illegal.”\n\nMist Glade raised an eyebrow. “Like sponsoring rebel militias? I can’t blame them for investing in extra security. Besides, Luna herself led us here with a dream. Has she ever led us astray?”\n\n“Well, no,” Silver Glade admitted.\n\n“I’ll keep an eye out for anything suspicious, but you need to relax. We can’t let these ponies know how desperate we are.”\n\nThe door opened as if on cue. Two earth pony guards stepped out and nodded to the thestrals. “He is ready to see you now.”\n\nThe brothers stood up and followed the guards out of the lobby further into the manor. They came to a set of large oak doors that swung open automatically as the group approached. The two guards stood to either side of the doorway, letting the thestral duo enter. Mist Glade raised an eyebrow as he passed them. Were they seriously going to leave their boss unprotected?\n\nThose thoughts died as he took in the vast office. The floor was polished wood, lined with a thin red carpet. Display cabinets and shelves lined the walls, filled with carved urns and ancient helmets neither brother could even hope to identify. At one side of the room there was a grey pegasus stallion staring intently at a black knife. The thestrals waited in awkward silence, unsure if the pegasus would take offence if they disturbed him. Luckily for them, it was the pegasus who spoke up first."

I’m sure you’ll recognise what this is?”\n\nThe thestrals shuffled closer to get a better look at the knife. It was pitch black, just shorter than a foreleg. The hilt was made from gold, woven tightly around the base of the black crystal blade in swirling sun patterns. The hilt was unblemished, but the blade was covered in a brown flaky substance.\n\n“I’m sorry, but I’m not sure what that is,” Silver Glade spoke up.\n\n“Figures. This is a Neighua sacrificial knife from the pre-unification days. It is made out of pure obsidian harvested from the fiery maw of Mt Poncatepetl itself and enchanted by unicorn priests to be free from wear and the ravages of time. This blade is as sharp today as it was two thousand years ago. Just think, how many lives were snuffed out by this knife in the name of the sun? How much blood stained those ancient temples?”\n\nMist and Silver shared a nervous look. The stallion’s tone remained neutral, but his orange eyes betrayed a deep fascination. He finally glanced up from the knife to look at the brothers.\n\n“You are the thestrals from Hollow Shades? I know what you seek, and it will be provided on one condition; you allow my men to participate in the fighting.”\n\nMist Glade tried to hide his unease. He didn’t recall telling the pegasus or his butler that they were from the Hollow Shades militia. The thestral pushed his thoughts aside, reasoning that Princess Luna must have visited the pegasus in a dream and told him to expect them.\n\n“Why would you want to participate?” Silver Glade asked.\n\n“Call it an investment. If your militia were to be defeated, there would be investigations and I would never receive my payment.”\n\nThat did make sense, but Mist Glade still felt uneasy. Some subconscious instinct was screaming at him to run, to flee this manor and never return. He shared a silent conversation with his brother before turning to speak with the stallion."

Bodies of thestrals littered the ground around him, but Silver Glade stood tall.\n\n“I’ll tell you what happened, your arms dealers screwed us!” Silver Glade shouted. The pegasus stallion had followed through on his word and delivered rifles, ammunition and even a few small artillery pieces to Hollow Shades, along with a brigade’s worth of mercenaries. Yet the second the fighting began, those mercenaries were nowhere to be seen, leaving Silver Glade’s small company to hold off the Royal Guards all alone.\n\nMist Glade growled. “They screwed me too. Poor Shadow Skies had to drag that cannon here by hoof since the mercs didn’t bring the truck they promised. That’s why we were so late.”\n\n“Well we’ve got the guns now. I say once this is all over, we give that sleazy pegasus-” The words died in Silver Glade’s throat. He looked past his brother, back toward Hollow Shades. Against the black of night, the thestral could faintly see a faint orange light where the town should be.\n\nFire.\n\n“Sweet Luna, the town is burning!” Silver Glade shouted.\n\nMist Glade turned pale, staring at the orange glow in mute horror."

The winds howled through the forest, feeding the inferno but doing nothing to stifle the screams.\n\nOne of the townsfolk sprinted over to the returning militia. “Thank Luna you’re here! You need to help us! Those mercenaries, they’re killing everypony!”\n\n“Calm down, you saying the mercs are responsible for this?” Mist Glade asked.\n\n“As soon as the Royal Guard were driven out, they started attacking us. They’ve gathered some of the townsfolk near the hall and burnt the rest to cover their tracks. Please, you need to help them! My sister is-”\n\n“Say no more, we’ll fly over and deal with these traitors,” Mist Glade told him. He gripped his rifle and took off, Silver Glade and the rest of the unit following just behind. A shimmering dome of yellow light could be spotted at the centre of town, and past that, rows upon rows of thestrals forced to the ground at gunpoint by the mercenaries.\n\n“Alright stallions, take position in the clouds and be ready to shoot down that shield on my-” One of the thestral soldiers screamed in pain as a bullet sliced through his shoulder, sending him spiralling down into the inferno below.\n\nPegasi leapt out of the clouds, slaughtering the small unit with a hail of rifle fire. Silver Glade never even had the chance to raise his gun before blinding pain ignited in his shoulder. He saw Mist Glade be tackled by a pegasus mare then felt something impact his helmet. There was a moment of weightlessness before he hit ground painfully, knocking his head against the hard cobblestone."

The thestral tried to struggle, but the white-robed pegasi held him in place.\n\n“If you think you can torture information out of me, you’ve got another thing coming!” Silver Glade spat. The pegasi remained silent. It was then Silver Glade heard a dull sound echoing through the forest. Chanting. The light of the fires consuming the town illuminated a circle of ponies, all chanting in perfect sync. At the sight of them, Silver Glade redoubled his efforts to escape .\n\nHe watched in mute horror as Mist Glade was dragged to a makeshift altar at the centre of the circle. A white-robed stallion loomed over the thestral, holding a black knife over his heart. Mist Glade screamed as the blade pierced his torso, spilling blood across the town square.\n\nTears sprung to Silver Glade’s eyes as the leader of the congregation kicked the body of his brother off the altar. It fell to the ground in an undignified heap. Runes carved into the ground flared up with a brilliant orange light, vanishing the body and the blood still staining the altar in a burst of magical fire.\n\n“Bring me the next sacrifice,” The figure commanded.\n\nThe pegasi dragged Silver Glade into the circle, ignoring his struggles and pleas. They slammed him back-first into the altar. The thestral tried to get up, but it was like some invisible force was holding him down.\n\n“Please, have mercy!” He begged, his heart now beating in time with the chants.\n\n“With this blood, we quench your thirst,” The leader murmured, raising a familiar black and gold knife above his next victim. “With this flesh, we sate your hunger. With this death, we bring you life!”\n\nThe knife plunged down, and Silver Glade knew no more.\n\n“Rise, Chalchiuhtl!”"

 paxsolaris.308.d:0 "It was the pegasi scouts that spotted the ruins first. At first, the news had relieved the Royal Guards, but as they approached the remains of Hollow Shades that relief had given way to dread. The thestral insurgents may have vanished, but whatever had wiped them out so thoroughly could still be lurking in darkness of the forest.\n\nThe town looked as if no pony had stepped hoof here for centuries. Blackened wood had rotted away under countless seasons, leaving only the sturdiest skeletons of homes remaining. Despite the apparent age of the ruins, the stench of decay still lingered. It didn’t take a genius to realise something horrible had happened here. Each guard could feel it in their bones.\n\nThey fled the ruined town quickly, leaving it to rot in the dark with its story forever lost to the world."
 paxsolaris.309.d:0 "“I tell you what, I’ll be happy to see Ma and Pa again,” Shadow Fall watched the trees pass by from the back of the truck with a wistful sigh.\n\n“Don’t get too comfortable,” Moonbright reminded him. “Hollow Shades went dark weeks ago. For all we know the solarists could be waiting for us.”\n\nThe truck lurched to the side, throwing the two thestrals out of their seats. Sergeant Dusk Wind tapped the front of the truck angrily. “What gives? Can’t you imbeciles keep us on the road?”\n\n“This is the road! The whole thing’s overgrown! I think we’ll have to continue on hoof.”\n\nThe soldiers groaned at the news. One by one they leapt off the truck, stretching their legs at the edge of the forest. Shadow Fall glanced ahead at the place he knew the road should be, only to find dense foliage. How had this grown in only a few months?\n\n“Shadow Fall,” Dusk Wind singled him out. “You know this forest best. Take Moonbright and fly ahead.”\n\n“Yes, sir!” Shadow Fall saluted. The two thestrals leapt into the air, hoping to spot Hollow Shades but finding nothing but trees in every direction. How could it be concealed? They should have at least spotted the steeple of the town hall by now! After an hour of flying, the thestral’s wings were aching. He touched down in a small clearing began to stretch his body, only to be paralysed with fear by what he saw. Blackened wood and moss-covered stone, weathered down by countless seasons. It was ruined, but Shadow could never forget his hometown.\n\n“What is this place?” Moonbright finally spoke up, shivering slightly.\n\n“Hollow Shades,” Shadow Fall replied, swallowing the lump in his throat. \n\n“Impossible,” Moonbright replied. She tapped one of the decaying wooden beams with her hoof. “These ruins must be at least a century old. Maybe more.”\n\nShe was right, it didn’t seem like another pony had been here for decades. Brickwork and structural beams were all that remained, everything else had rotted away or been reclaimed by the forest.\n\n“That’s where Blue Moon used to sell fruit pies. Over there is the schoolhouse,” Shadow Fall wiped a tear from his eye. “And that’s the home I grew up in. This is Hollow Shades. Or at least, it was.”\n\nBoth thestrals shivered as a cold wind blew through the husk of a town. It almost seemed to beckon to them, crying out against its fate. Shadow Fall tried to listen, but the feeling disappeared. He turned back to Moonbright, a look of horrified disbelief on his face."

 paxsolaris.310.d:0 "Celestia slammed the door shut as she stormed into her study, leaving ashen footprints in her wake. She slumped down at the balcony, casting a grief-filled glare up at the moon. A part of Celestia swanted to give Luna the benefit of the doubt, but the evidence against her sister was mounting.\n\nDid Luna think her senile? Did she believe a millennia of guiding ponykind towards utopia had left Celestia unable to spot a lie when she saw one? If the disembodied spirit of Nightmare Moon really was organising an army, Luna would know. She was not the undisputed master of the dream world for nothing.\n\nIt seemed Luna was just as determined to tear Equestria down as she was one thousand years ago. Her actions would once again bring ruin to ponykind, but Celestia would be damned if she allowed that to happen. This time, she would not ignore the signs. She had Twilight and the Elements. Maybe they could exorcise Luna of these lingering demons? If not... Celestia would be forced to take extreme measures.\n\nTears ran down her face, but the princess narrowed her eyes and caused them to boil away. There was no room for these feelings. Her nation was on the brink of civil war. Now more than ever did ponykind need Celestia to be strong. If that meant banishing her sister for another thousand years..."

 paxsolaris.311.d:0 "Canterlot was in chaos. Everywhere Celestia looked there were ponies panicking as the unholy red glow of the blood moon forced them to experience their darkest nightmares. Under its baleful light, even Celestia felt terror clutch her heart, though the moon did not show her a nightmare. How could it, when her nightmare had become reality?\n\nCelestia reached out with her magic, doing whatever she could to fight back against the blood moon’s influence. She knew where this magic was coming from. She could sense the nexus of darkness that had gathered over Manehattan and feel its familiar sting. Why did Luna have to put her through this again? Tears streamed down Celestia’s face as she fought with her sister for ponykind’s sanity.\n\nThe princess snarled and poured more power into the spell. She threw all her pain and fury at this evil curse and felt it crack. A brilliant beam of golden light shot from her horn, outshining even the horrible red light of the moon. Even when the effort caused her mane to burst into flames, Celestia didn’t give up. The curse gave way and Celestia scoured the moon’s surface, leaving it a pure white.\n\nShe opened her eyes and found the marble around her had been melted in the fury of her magic. Ponies looked around with dazed expressions, glancing in shock between the purified moon and Celestia. The alicorn ignored them and turned to the nearest royal guard.\n\n“Order an immediate evacuation of the city. Nightmare Moon is coming. She cannot ignore this challenge to her dominion over the night.”\n\nThe guard saluted, but Celestia had already left. She teleported to the foot of the royal palace and summoned her ancient battle regalia in preparation for her sister's arrival. Resting her war hammer on the marble floor, the princess waited."

The dark alicorn turned to her sister and smirked.\n\n“There is no need to be so glum, dear sister. Think of this as a much needed change in leadership. Equestria is merely receiving a better and more powerful ruler!”\n\n“Why sister?” Celestia asked, ignoring the jab. “Why are you doing this?”\n\nNightmare Moon sneered. “Don’t act like you care! You’re stuck in your perfect little world where everypony loves you and nothing bad ever happens. You don’t care about me and you never have!”\n\n“That’s not true, Luna,” Celestia took a step closer to the dark alicorn, tears brimming in her eyes. “I love you. Please don’t do this again. It’s not too late to turn back.”\n\n“Oh you love me?” Nightmare Moon rolled her eyes. “Then explain to me why after a thousand years I am still just as shunned!”\n\nCelestia sighed, wishing Luna could just be reasonable. She was willing to give her sister a third chance, but her patience was beginning to wear thin. What had Luna ever given her besides pain and despair? It was her fault that Celestia had spent the last thousand years leading her nation alone. Even after everything she’d done to plan for Luna’s return so they could be sisters again, the ungrateful brat still decided to throw it all back in her face. Celestia had shown forgiveness and only had a fractured nation to show for it."

Who do you think runs this nation? Perhaps ponykind just likes me more because I won’t send millions to the slaughter over my childish insecurities!”\n\nFor a brief second, Nightmare Moon appeared shocked. Then her face contorted into a hateful glare. “How dare you! You know nothing of what it’s like to be shunned! You call me petty as if you don’t hog attention like the selfish control freak you are!”\n\n“Selfish? You think you have the right to call me selfish!? I have sacrificed more for this nation that you could even begin imagine! Do you even know what state you left Equestria in after your first tantrum? Of course you don’t, and I doubt you ever cared enough to find out. I was the one responsible for keeping ponies from starving to death, all that ever concerns you is whether or not they like your reflective ball of rock.”\n\nSomething angry stirred in Celestia’s heart. Something that begged for release. She had felt this feeling many times before and for the first time in her long life, Celestia considered giving in. Nightmare Moon was saying something, but her words fell on deaf ears. Celestia had made her decision.\n\n“I’ve tried being reasonable with you, Luna. We’re sisters.

Then she was gone, leaving only the demon her sister had become. Celestia blinked the tears out of her eyes.\n\nNightmare Moon flared her wings and took to the air. “Enough talk!

As the light grew more intense, it began to burn away Celestia’s rainbow mane. Her skin glowed like the surface of the sun, making it impossible for even Nightmare Moon to look at her directly. She took an involuntary step backwards as hollow, mocking laughter began to echo across Canterlot.\n\nThe energy exploded outwards, painting the floor a sooty black. Nightmare Moon grunted as the force of the explosion impacted her shield. The light faded and she could finally see the demon of fire her sister had become.\n\nShe was tall. Taller than Celestia or any alicorn had ever been. Her mane and tail were tongues of fire angrily lashing out at the surrounding air. As the fire subsided, Celestia opened her wrathful eyes and for the first time in many years, Nightmare Moon felt fear.\n\nCelestia roared her anger to the heavens, her aura flaring up as she fed it her hate. Finally, she turned her gaze back to Nightmare Moon. Never before had Luna or Nightmare Moon ever seen their look upon another creature with such loathing.\n\n“I hope you now understand how far beneath me you are, sister,” The solar alicorn practically spat the last word.\n\n“This doesn’t change anything!” Nightmare Moon stepped forward, regaining her confidence. “You will still be defeated by my hoof!”\n\nCelestia chuckled, amused by her declaration."

You would send this nation to Tartarus for your ambitions but can’t take a simple beating? You always were pathetic.”\n\nNightmare Moon managed to teleport out of the hammer’s path, but Daybreaker was waiting for her with a bolt of white-hot magic. She narrowly dodged the beam then spun around to send a jet of dark magic at her foe.\n\n“You have no idea how much I dreaded a day like this would come to pass,” Daybreaker approached her beaten sister, summoning a shield to block the weak attack. “Even if you did, I doubt you’d care. You don’t care about anypony but yourself. This is the second time you’ve broken my heart in this vainglorious quest to secure love you never deserved.”\n\nCrimson magic ensnared Nightmare Moon by the forelegs and dragged her across the barren ground before dumping her at Daybreaker’s hooves.\n\n“I won’t let you break it again. This time, I’m going to end you. Permanently.”\n\nThe stars dimmed as Daybreaker gathered magic. Nightmare Moon desperately tried to coax life into her blackened horn, glancing fearfully at the supernova gathering around her sister. The temperature rose sharply, melting the ground around the solar princess and whipping the air into a whirlwind. The younger sister redoubled her efforts and was rewarded by a weak cyan light gathering at the end of her horn.\n\nDaybreaker’s eyes shone like the sun itself. There was no emotion in those eyes, but for a second Nightmare Moon swore she could see a thin trail of molten metal run down the alicorn’s cheek.

 paxsolaris.322.d:0 "A knock broke the silence of Nightmare Moon’s chambers. The door was flung open by an aura of blue magic, letting a nervous thestral guard approach the night queen.\n\n“Why have you disturbed me?” A cold voice came from the black alicorn at the other end of the room.\n\n“My Queen, the generals are waiting for you,” Dusk Wind said, cautiously trotting to where Nightmare Moon sat on a lavish Zebrican rug. Her slitted eyes were closed and she was taking long, deep breaths. Were it not for the glowing of her horn, Dusk might have thought the alicorn asleep.\n\n“Do you think I need to sign off on every inane decision? Leave me. I have important matters to attend to,” Nightmare Moon snapped back. She kept her eyes firmly shut and reached out across the dream world. Something wasn’t right. The dream world was never this turbulent. There was a sinister anger poisoning the peaceful landscape.\n\n“They were very exact about their request, your majesty. There have been... developments on the frontline.”\n\nNightmare Moon felt her temper flare. “Did I stutter? Leave me!”\n\nThe thestral hurried out of the bedroom, leaving the alicorn to her task. She knew who was responsible for this poison but struggled to believe it. Celestia may have not been the perfect monarch ponykind portrayed her as, Nightmare Moon knew this better than anypony, but she’d never felt such raw hatred from her sister before. Not even during her first rebellion.\n\nThe dark alicorn extended her consciousness towards the mass of psychic energy she knew to be her sister’s mind. Much to her surprise, there were no mental barriers established. Did Celestia… want her thoughts to be read? No, that was ridiculous. Clearly she was just too foolish to keep them up. Nightmare Moon pushed her worries aside and extended her consciousness forward, establishing a mental link with her sister’s mind. "

 paxsolaris.323.d:0 "Daybreaker emerged from the ruined war room with a triumphant glint in her burning eyes. Her mind already whirled with plans. With the last of her inhibitions gone, there was nothing to stop her from scouring away the rot that still lingered in her nation. She stormed through the palace, passing terrified servants as she made her way to the briefing room where she knew Luna would be meeting with the High Command.\n\nThe guards posted to the briefing room backed away in horror as Daybreaker approached. They tried to raise their rifles, but a pleasant warmth put a stop to their efforts.\n\n“You would not raise your weapons against your empress, would you?” Daybreaker asked.\n\n“Princess? Is that you?” One of the guards stammered.\n\nDaybreaker grinned, revealing her sharpened fangs. “Not anymore, my little pony.”\n\nThe guard struggled to connect the image of the princess he’d served his entire life to the fiery alicorn that stood before him. Her coat was the same pale white, yet it now shone with an unnatural glow. The shape of her face was familiar and yet so different. All the features were the same, but where Celestia had always appeared serene and peaceful, this alicorn looked focused and predatory. It was the eyes that told the guard everything he needed to know. The calming purple of her eyes were gone, replaced by a maelstrom of hateful fire.\n\nYet despite her terrifying appearance, he felt safe. Those eyes held untold amounts of malice, but it was not directed towards him. He had seen this look in the faces of the soldiers on the frontline; the look of a pony who would lay down their lives so others would never experience the pain they felt. Everything clicked into place and the guards bowed deeply, letting Daybreaker pass.\n\n“Forgive me, my empress.”\n\nDaybreaker smiled and flung the doors open with her crimson magic. Silence fell across the room as each pony turned to Daybreaker, their eyes widening in disbelief. Luna was the first to break the silence, a look of petrified horror on her face."

One can only watch their children be slaughtered for so long before they realise their limitless power is wasted hosting tea parties for Equestria’s enemies.”\n\n“You don’t have to do this!” Luna begged, her eyes wide and tearful. “You don’t have to make the same mistake I did. Whatever is causing you this pain, we can deal with it together. Please Tia, stop this madness!”\n\nDaybreaker faltered a step. Then she snarled, the fire in her mane doubling in intensity. “Do not call me that! Celestia was a weak and cowardly fool. She did nothing but watch as her ponies were slaughtered. I’m here to put an end to that. From this day forward, I will take my place as the protector, mother and goddess of my ponies! They will know me as Daybreaker; Empress of Ponykind and the scourge of its foes!”\n\n“No! Celestia was- IS stronger than you!” Luna shot back, blinking tears out of her eyes as she stood between Daybreaker and the terrified group of generals. “She had the strength to forgive me when even I could not. nI know she’s still in there.

If you refuse, know that I will not allow you to stop ponykind from achieving their destined glory. My subjects are far more important to me than you, Luna.”\n\n“No, I won’t be a part of this madness! Please Tia-”\n\n“I TOLD YOU NOT TO CALL ME THAT!” Crimson light seized Luna by the throat and slammed her through the window. The dark alicorn landed roughly at the foot of the palace and rolled limply down the stairs. Daybreaker leapt through the broken window and landed just above Luna, the masonry cracking under her hooves.\n\n“I don’t know what I was expecting. You never cared for ponykind as I did! It is no wonder you won’t take the next step in securing their future. Very well. I will not have your weakness staining my empire.”\n\nLuna slowly got back to her hooves and turned to her corrupted sister. “A thousand years ago, you showed great strength in opposing me when I lost myself. I never thought one day I would have to repay the favour. Whatever happens, know that I love you, Tia.”\n\nFor the briefest moment, Luna swore she could see thin wisps of steam escape her sister’s eyes.

Houses were burning, the sky was red and the grass beneath her was blackened and lifeless. She could feel her strength waning with each blow and Daybreaker’s attacks only seemed to get more vicious as the battle wore on, but it would all be worth it if she could just hold on long enough for somepony to get word to Twilight and the other element bearers.\n\nHer moment of distraction cost her dearly when Daybreaker cast another blinding beam of crimson energy at her. The beam shattered her shield with a deafening bang and continued onwards, blasting Luna into the castle wall. The back of her head slammed into the hard stone, sending stars flashing across her vision. For a second, Luna considered just giving up, but something in the back of her mind pushed her onwards.\n\nSlowly, Luna got back on her hooves. Daybreaker chuckled as she glided out of the raging inferno to land just a few metres from the moon princess. There was a playful smile on her face. It broke Luna’s heart to see her sister’s radiant smile marred by those evil fangs.\n\n“Don’t fret, Luna. I’ll make sure the world remembers your name. For a thousand years they will tell the story of how the sun defeated the moon at the dawning of the Solar Empire!”\n\nLuna leapt forward, trying to catch Daybreaker by surprise while she was monologuing. Just as she was about to close the distance, a crimson aura tightened around her neck, preventing her from moving. Daybreaker gave Luna a smug grin before slamming her back into the palace wall."

She shot away from Daybreaker and rematerialised at the other end of the courtyard, stumbling slightly as she was hit with a sudden wave of nausea. She could already feel her beaten and bruised body giving up on her. That trick had nearly depleted her magic reserves and all she’d done was bought herself a few more seconds until Daybreaker traced her magic signature and resumed her relentless attack.\n\nLuna couldn’t help the tears that gathered in her eyes. It wasn’t supposed to end like this! Everything had been perfect. Celestia had forgiven her when Luna couldn’t even forgive herself. Harmony was spreading across the world. Ponykind was at peace. That world was now ash, just like the ground beneath her hooves.\n\nA foreign emotion wormed its way into her mind. Anger. Celestia had burnt that perfect world down! First with her ‘reforms’, then with her transformation into Daybreaker! She cast us out just for wanting recognition, only to become worse than we ever were!\n\nLuna paused. Those thoughts and feelings were not her own. So where had they come from? Before she could investigate further, a pleasant voice soothed her fears. It was foreign and yet so hauntingly familiar. The voice spoke to her like an old friend. Her only friend. It promised the strength to end Daybreaker’s madness and right an ancient wrong. All Luna had to do was embrace it.\n\n“There you are!” Daybreaker shouted. In a blink of an eye, she was standing before Luna, a vicious glint in her eye. “How foolish. The shadows cannot protect you from the sun!”\n\nAnother explosion sent Luna flying back, but she twisted her wings around and landed on her hooves, glaring at Daybreaker with all the defiance she could muster. The voice was now screaming in her mind. Luna knew its name. She knew the power it offered.\n\n“You are strong, sister...”"

No matter how much you hurt me or how much evil you commit, I won’t stop caring for you.”\n\nFor a brief moment, Daybreaker appeared speechless. The flames in her mane dimmed enough for Luna to see traces of rainbow lingering at the edges.\n\n“Ponies are dead because of me, Luna,” Daybreaker turned away, but Luna could still see thin wisps of steam escape her sister's eyes. “That is unforgivable.”\n\n“That’s not your fault. It’s the fault of creatures like Chrysalis, Sombra and Tirek. You have done nothing but care for ponykind. I know you would never harm them, so don’t blame yourself for all the cruel monsters out there.”\n\nLuna took a step forward only for Daybreaker to shuffle backwards. There was a look of fearful disbelief in her eyes, as if she was unable to comprehend her sister’s words. Sensing her uncertainty, Luna extended her hoof, ignoring the shrieking voice of Nightmare Moon ordering her to attack.\n\n“Please Celestia. I want to help you.”\n\nDaybreaker glanced between the offered hoof and the smile on Luna’s. Then she snarled, the fire of her hair lashing out angrily. “I am the sun! I have the power to shred this planet to its atoms! My ponies are dead because I did nothing to save them! There can be no forgiveness for me until every wretched creature that has ever spilt pony blood has been burned alive!”\n\nThe heat radiating from the solar alicorn was unbearable, but Luna forced herself to take another step closer. “Your heart is in the right place, but if you walk this path, you’ll only make ponykind’s enemies more numerous. You don’t have to do this. We can make the world safe and happy together.”\n\nLuna closed the last of the distance separating her from Daybreaker and pulled her into a hug. Even when the flames of Daybreaker’s mane charred the flesh of her forelegs, the younger sister refused to let go. “I love you, Celestia. It breaks my heart to see you in this much pain.”\n\nA powerful force slammed into Luna, sending her flying across the ashen gardens. She forced herself back to her hooves and saw Daybreaker glaring at her. The eldest sister snarled in anger, but her eyes were terrified and confused."

It wound itself tightly around her bones, activating the long-forgotten power that lay dormant within the night princess. She kept her gaze on Daybreaker as she felt her anger steadily rise. A dark aura gathered around her, devouring the light of the morning sky. Even Daybreaker’s radiance dimmed in the face of the all-consuming blackness.\n\nYes, this was the power Luna needed! Celestia had revealed her true self, proving all of Luna's doubts and suspicions correct. She lied to the world, lied to her sister! While Celestia was chastising Luna for simply wanting recognition, she had been secretly nurturing thos flaming monument to her own arrogance. Now that fate had offered Celestia the opportunity to do away with these illusions of equality between night and day, she pretended to care about ponykind so Luna would let her guard down! All these thoughts rushed into the alicorn, fed to her by one the being that knew her weaknesses and vulnerabilities better than Luna herself. As the thoughts rushed in, the last of her resistance began to crumble.\n\n“Sister, please...” Luna’s voice faded away. The last thing she saw were the flaming eyes of Daybreaker, watching her with callous indifference. Then she was forced to the back of her consciousness as a new presence took control.\n\nNightmare Moon had returned.\n\n“Ah, it feels so good to be free,” The dark alicorn laughed. Her arrival had revitalised the night princess, healing her injuries and replenishing her depleted magic reserves.\n\n“So the traitor finally shows her true colours,” Daybreaker mused. Her indifferent expression morphed into a wide grin. “Good. It will make for a better story when I scatter your ashes across Tartarus.”\n\nNightmare Moon chuckled and fashioned a long blade out of her magic."

There had to be hundreds of names here, all belonging to one of the harmonist officers that betrayed her so many months ago.\n\nThe alicorn was aware that her popularity had surged to an all-time high in recent weeks, surpassing even the admiration she had enjoyed as Celestia. It warmed her heart to hear her name cheered instead of cursed. After all, protecting ponies was so much easier when they were willing to obey her orders.\n\nSo many new possibilities had opened up, but Daybreaker had never expected the defectors to beg for her forgiveness and request to rejoin the army. Three days ago, she had received a ten-page letter apologising for what they called a hasty and paranoid decision. They went on to pledge loyalty to her, asking for the chance to atone for their mistakes through military service. Daybreaker had met with the organisers of the group and couldn’t detect a hint of treachery. As hard as it was to believe, their intentions were genuine.\n\nShe allowed a small smile to grace her lips. This letter had come as a surprise, but not an unwelcome one.

Who did Celestia think she was, summoning him and then making him wait with these filthy commoners? He was a general! Granted, Idle Rich had never actually commanded anything larger than a house party, but he liked to think he did his fair share. After all, somepony had to keep the economy alive in these trying times. If he made a nice profit in the process, who was he to complain?\n\nThe doors swung open and a group of ponies stumbled out. Idle Rich quickly recognised them as the peasant rabble Celestia had promoted in favour of more deserving candidates suggested by the peerage, but something was different about them. They appeared pale and frightened, either angrily whispering with their neighbours or scurrying out of the palace. He watched them leave with a disinterested glare.\n\nAs soon as they had left, the temperature soared. Ponies cried out in shock when a tornado of fire appeared on the throne. He watched in stunned disbelief as an alicorn stepped out of the flames. She towered over the crowd, standing tall and proud in red-hot armour with a mane of fire roaring behind her. Her coat was a pale white and glowed from the inside with unnatural power. Despite himself, Idle Rich couldn’t help but shiver as her gaze fell upon them.\n\n“Greetings, sycophants and traitors. I am sorry for making you wait, but I just had a very enlightening meeting with my high command to access their loyalty. I’m a busy mare, so I’ll just skip straight to the part where I burn you alive.”\n\nFear paralysed the noble stallion. Before her words could truly sink in, the doors and windows were sealed shut by crimson magic. The unicorns desperately tried to teleport away, but something kept from leaving.\n\n“You pathetic creatures. How dare you think your titles give you power over the sun? I’ve listened to your endless complaining for a thousand years, wasting my valuable time just to satiate your egos,” The monstrous alicorn smiled as flames gathered around her horn. “That ends today. I am going to reforge Equestria into an empire of unparalleled might and prosperity, and I won’t let you stand in my way.”\n\nScreams of pain and terror echoed through the palace. Agent Sweetie Drops listened to their cries through a crack in the throne room door until she couldn’t stomach it any longer. With trembling hooves, the agent reached for her radio."

She spiralled through the raging blizzard and landed hard against the Canterhorn mountain, the packed ice doing little to cushion the impact. Daybreaker glided out of the sky, her burning aura causing the snow to evaporate around her.\n\n“Why didn’t you accept my offer?!” Daybreaker demanded. “Why, Luna? You stand between me and the total annihilation of all evil in this world!”\n\nShe didn’t wait for Luna to respond before stomping down on her injured wing. The night princess screamed in agony and tried to escape the crimson magic keeping her pinned to the ground. As the initial pain faded, Luna forced air into her aching lungs and brought her eyes up to meet her sister’s.\n\n“I don’t care how many monsters you kill, I just want my sister back. Please Celestia, you don’t have to do this! There are other ways. I know these past years have been hard on you and I’m sorry for not noticing, but friendship still has a place in the world. You just need to give it a chance.”\n\nDaybreaker sighed and stepped away, allowing Luna to pick herself up off the ground.\n\n“I gave friendship a chance and it failed me,” The alicorn’s eyes dimmed to mere embers. “It’s too late to change me, Luna. I’m done with watching from the sidelines. You had your chance to do the same, but you chose weakness. I’m sorry it had to come to this, but I can’t let you stand in my way.”\n\nLuna summoned a barrier just in time to block a jet of fire, but the force behind the attack still sent her stumbling to the ground. Cracks began to appear in her shield and the night princess knew she wasn’t going to last much longer. She focused her magic and tensed her legs, knowing she’d only get one chance at this.\n\nWhen the shield broke Luna leapt into the air, expertly twisting her body and unfurling her wings just as a powerful shockwave sent her catapulting into the sky. With the borrowed momentum, she rightened herself and glided east, leaving her wrathful sister alone on the ashen battlefield. The thought of leaving Celesta behind filled her heart with grief, but Luna refused to shed another tear. Crying was for those who had already given up. "

Her once-pristine coat was now stained with her own burning blood, the result of a hundred cuts covering her body.\n\nA barrage of cyan blades shot out of the darkness, shattering against the white alicorn’s flaming shield. Daybreaker growled and sent a jet of fire at her sister, only for the younger alicorn to disappear into a cloud of shadows.\n\n“Enough games, Luna! Show yourself!” Daybreaker demanded, her words dripping with frustration and rage.\n\n“I’m begging you sister, end this madness,” Luna appeared before the alicorn, her eyes wide and pleading . Daybreaker spun around to face her and charged her horn with another flame spell.\n\n“You just don’t get it, do you? This is not madness,” Daybreaker flashed Luna a vicious grin. “There is nothing mad about wanting to protect your children. The truth is, Luna, I’ve never felt more sane!”\n\n“I know. When I was Nightmare Moon, I thought I was doing the right thing. I was so consumed by rage and jealousy that nothing could have convinced me I was wrong. Just like nothing will convince you to renounce your destructive ambitions.”\n\n“Then why waste time with words?” Daybreaker spat. She slowly approached the moon princess, herding her towards the castle wall. “You took a great risk appearing before me. I could reduce you to atoms in a heartbeat.”\n\n“Because I know my kind and loving sister will never be beyond saving,” Luna stood still, not even flinching as Daybreaker bared her fanged teeth. “It may take decades to heal the pain in your heart, but I will show you the same forgiveness you showed me.”\n\nDaybreaker snarled and unleashed an explosion of plasma at her sister. It blasted the wall apart, but when the glow faded, the image of Luna was still standing in her way. It flickered once before winking out of existence. Before Daybreaker could realise she’d been tricked, the real Luna leapt out of the darkness and pinned Daybreaker to the ground with shadowy chains."

She found Nightmare Moon collapsed against the palace wall, her armour cracked by the solar alicorn’s magic.\n\nDaybreaker sneered at her struggling sister and charged up her horn. “Pathetic. Even in this form you pale in comparison to me.”\n\nNightmare Moon managed to teleport out of her sister’s path, but Daybreaker was waiting for her with another bolt of white-hot magic. She narrowly dodged the beam then spun around to send a jet of dark magic at her foe.\n\n“You know, a part of me was still unsure about killing you,” Daybreaker approached her beaten sister, summoning a shield to block the weak attack. “So thank you for showing your true colours. You’ve helped silence my hesitation.”\n\nCrimson magic ensnared Nightmare Moon by the forelegs and dragged her across the barren ground before dumping her at Daybreaker’s hooves.\n\n“The future of the Solar Empire has room for only one goddess. And that goddess will be ME!”\n\nThe sun brightened as Daybreaker gathered magic. Nightmare Moon desperately tried to coax life into her blackened horn, glancing fearfully at the supernova gathering around her sister. The temperature rose sharply, melting the ground around the solar princess and whipping the air into a whirlwind. The younger sister redoubled her efforts and was rewarded by a weak cyan light gathering at the end of her horn.\n\nDaybreaker’s eyes shone like the sun itself. There was no emotion in those eyes, but for a second Nightmare Moon swore she could see a thin trail of molten metal run down her sister’s cheek. Then her spell activated, and Nightmare Moon disappeared into the dream world mere moments before Daybreaker released her magic, instantly vaporising an entire suburb of Canterlot."

Do I get even a shred of recognition for my work? No. Ponykind was always too busy fawning over you.”\n\nDaybreaker cast her wrathful eyes to a shape in the gloom. It was darker than the surrounding shadows, as if something had devoured all the light in that spot. The shapeless mass glided forward, gradually taking the form of an alicorn.

Again and again they struck, pressing in from all sides at the command of their mistress. Daybreaker fought against the primal fear threatened to consume her and focused her magic. A beam of plasma pierced the shadows, allowing sunlight to flood the tiny space.\n\nDaybreaker leapt for the opening, terror driving her wings forward even as the shadows threatened to drag her back into the abyss.

There were many words he could use to describe Midwinter Halo, few of them pleasant. He’d attended Celestia’s School for Gifted Unicorns with the mare and while she was a brilliant student of magic, there was always something... off about her. Flattery that never felt sincere. Smiles that didn’t quite reach her eyes.\n\nAfter graduation, Iron Valour had all but forgotten about the odd mare until they met again in officers training. Once again Midwinter excelled even when their teachers had shown concerns about her eagerness to employ cruel tactics in their wargames. Perhaps if somebody had looked closer, they could have done something, but Midwinter's pleasant smile and soft demeanour blinded them to her true nature. They only saw a young and talented officer eager to serve her nation. She passed officer training with flying colours and was sent to command the Severyan garrison.\n\nThen came the Winter Revolution. It was a short war. By the time Iron Valour had arrived, Celestia had already ordered a retreat. The returning soldiers told stories of a mare who had ordered them to show no quarter to the traitors. Her mages had salted fields, slaughtered prisoners and torched entire villages, leaving only ash and scorched bones in their wake. He shouldn’t have been surprised when Midwinter Halo was identified as the one responsible.\n\nCelestia had seen the mare rot in prison for her action and Iron Valour had hoped in vain that was the last he would see of her. Yet here she was, once more commanding the armies of Equestria under Daybreaker’s orders. Iron Valour wished he had taken the opportunity to resign when Daybreaker had first offered it, but the implied threat had cowed him into compliance. Now he was surrounded by psychopaths and madmares, trying not to flinch every time they glanced his way."

Reality heaved as the energy blasted through the sky, arcing down and exploding against the side of a mountain with a crack that could be heard across Equestria. Rocky debris rained from the sky, covering the ground around Luna with craters.\n\nThe earth trembled as Daybreaker landed. Luna managed to turn her head towards her sister, a look of disbelief written on her face. She looked like she wanted to say something, but couldn’t quite manage the words.\n\nDaybreaker gave Luna a piercing glare. “That was a warning. If you ever show your face in my nation again, I won’t miss.”\n\n“Why? Why spare me?”\n\n“Does it matter? You’re alive. Now go, before I change my mind. This is my nation and my ponies to lead. You have no place here.”\n\nLuna forced herself to her hooves. “Celestia...I-”\n\n“LEAVE!” Daybreaker screamed as she gripped Luna with her magic and threw the alicorn into the air.

 paxsolaris.342.d:0 "Twilight paced around her study, nervously glancing between the clock and telegraph line. It had been hours since she had sent out urgent missives to all her friends and she had yet to receive a single response. Despite her best efforts, the alicorn was starting to panic. Princess Celestia was missing, Canterlot was locked down and there were strange ponies attacking civilians in the dead of night.\n\nShe couldn’t even check if her friends were alright. Pinkie and Applejack were off leading their armies, Rarity was in Manehattan designing uniforms, Spike was with the Crystal Ponies drumming up morale, Fluttershy was in Canterlot and Rainbow Dash was Celestia knows where. They would usually keep in touch via magic journals and telegrams, but those had been silent for days now. Her friends could be dead for all Twilight knew.\n\nA chime brought the young alicorn out of her panic attack. Something had breached the perimeter. Just as Twilight was about to ignite her horn, an incredibly powerful magical presence assaulted her mind, forcing her to the ground with spots dancing across her vision.\n\n“Really, Twilight. I thought I taught you better than to assault your mentor.”\n\n“Princess Celestia! I’m so sorry. I-” But when she opened her eyes, Twilight found herself unable to speak. Terror had sucked the words from her mouth. She backed away slowly, glancing at the intruder with an expression of pure horror.\n\nIt was Celestia, but a version of her that Twilight had only ever seen in her darkest nightmares. She surveyed Twilight with an expression of passive amusement, as if she enjoyed the younger alicorn’s distress. It was all Twilight could do to not break down under the gaze of those burning eyes."

 paxsolaris.343.t:0 "The Errant Student"
 paxsolaris.343.d:0 "“Y-You...” Twilight stammered. “What have you done with Celestia!?”\n\n“What kind of question is that? I am Celestia!” The alicorn laughed, stepping closer to Twilight who was forced to recoil away from her flaming mane. “Or rather, I am what Celestia should have been. Powerful, magnificent, willing to fight the threats Equestria faces with more than just hope and good intentions. You may call me Daybreaker.”\n\nTwilight was paralysed to the spot, sweating under the heat of the alicorn’s aura. Please, anyone. Let this be a dream!\n\n“I understand that you are scared. After all, it is perfectly natural to fear change. But without it, there can be no improvement. Rest assured, my motivations remain the same. I love my little ponies more than life itself. Just think of this as a much-needed change in methodology. Do you understand, my faithful student?”\n\n“Don’t say that!” Twilight yelled, anger giving her the courage she needed to speak. “You’re not Celestia!”\n\nDaybreaker smiled like a parent dealing with an unruly child. “Oh, but I am. What you see before you is simply the natural evolution of a being who has grown tired of others taking advantage of her hospitality to slaughter her children. I don’t expect you to understand right now. Fortunately, we have all the time in the world to discuss the matter further.”\n\nBefore Twilight could even blink, an invisible force reached into her mind. She felt her eyelids grow heavy before she collapsed to the floor. Through her fading vision, she saw soldiers barge into her study and begin carefully rifling through her letters to her friends. Daybreaker stepped past her, turning her gaze towards the crystalline mirror pushed up against the wall."

 paxsolaris.344.d:0 "Hooves thundered on stone as the four mares charged through the palace hallways. It shouldn’t be this easy. The remaining element bearers had expected escaping from their captors to be a desperate struggle, but the Imperial Palace was empty. Which could only mean one thing: they were walking into a trap. But what choice did they have? Twilight and Dash were counting on them.\n\nApplejack spun around and delivered a mighty kick to the golden doors of the throne room, sending them flying off their hinges. Her eyes landed on the creature sitting on the throne, causing the farmpony to stand rigid with terror. It was one thing hear rumours about Celestia’s fall to evil, but to see the horrifying truth right before your eyes...\n\n“Where are they?” She demanded, biting back her fear. Rarity, Pinkie and Fluttershy stepped to either side of the mare, each flinching as the fiery alicorn’s gaze swept across them. They could feel her power and somehow knew she could turn them all to ash in the blink of an eye.\n\n“Ah, the Elements of Harmony. Would you care for some tea?” Daybreaker offered, smiling down at the group.\n\n“Don’t try to play coy with us!” Rarity spat. “Tell us where you’re keeping Twilight and Rainbow Dash!”\n\nA flash of surprise passed across Daybreaker’s face, but it was gone in a heartbeat. “I’m afraid that’s not possible. While I may loathe to imprison my faithful student, her use to me is too great to allow her freedom. As for Miss Dash, I’m afraid I don’t know where she is.”\n\nPinkie Pie leapt forward, crossing the throne room at blinding speeds until her nose was almost touching the solar alicorn’s.\n\n“Enough lies!” The pink mare shouted. Her blue eyes were burning with anger and her hair was dead straight, a sight that would be enough to scare even her close friends. “Where are they?”"

However, four will be good enough.”\n\n“What... what did you want to talk about?” Fluttershy asked.\n\n“Nothing particularly important. I just hoped we could reach an understanding,” Daybreaker gave them a warm smile. “I hold no ill-will towards you four. You have each served Equestria dutifully, and for that I commend you. However, I can’t have you standing in my way.”\n\n“So what, you’re going to imprison us?” Applejack raised an eyebrow. “Or just skip straight to the execution?”\n\nDaybreaker laughed, the sound echoing off the walls like a haunting melody. “If I wanted you dead, I wouldn’t have wasted time bringing you all to Canterlot. No, I simply wish to propose an offer. You return to Ponyville, keep your noses out of my affairs, and I’ll let you live your lives. How does that sound?”\n\nApplejack looked into the demon’s eyes and saw their desperate plan going up in smoke. Those weren’t the eyes of a deranged lunatic. They were cruel and calculating, watching their every move with a cold detachment. She offered them no openings or weaknesses to exploit and without the other element bearers, Applejack and the other three were powerless against her. The only thing they could do was take the alicorn’s mercy and live to fight another day.\n\n“And what’s stopping us from causing trouble if we take your offer?” Applejack asked. She shivered as a wide grin appeared on the alicorn’s face.\n\n“You all have loved ones. Friends, parents, siblings; I know them all. I know where they live, what they do and who they speak with. My agents will be keeping a close watch on them. If I ever suspect you have betrayed my trust... well, you get the picture. Do we have an understanding?”\n\nThe four mares exchanged looks of horror, their minds conjuring images of all the ponies Daybreaker would kill if they ever raised a hoof against her. None of them were willing to put the lives of others on the line, and the demon knew it. She’d taken their greatest strength and made it their weakness."

 sol_dialogue_text_53:0 "§O“Do you have any idea how much planning it took to get you six together?

I suffered humiliation after humiliation so that you could grow, all leading up to the moment of your ascension. A moment I had predicted decades before you were born.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_62:0 "§O“But in my arrogance, I allowed my vision to be clouded. Stalliongrad should have done away with my delusions of control. But I convinced myself the stress of planning my sister’s return had caused me to overlook the evil festering in my own nation.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_63:0 "§O“I even chose to ignore the darkness that lurked in the hearts of our enemies even as they plotted our downfall. I’ve seen ponykind be wiped out in a thousand different ways and ignored each one because I had faith that friendship could persevere in even the most monstrous of creatures.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_64:0 "§O“But that’s in the past now. I will not make the same mistake again.”§!"

 sol_dialogue_text_68:0 "§O“This tea is delightful. Wouldn’t you agree, Twilight?”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_69:0 "§O“You’re awfully quiet today. Is something wrong?”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_70:0 "§S“Why am I here?”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_71:0 "§O“Because I captured you, of course.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_72:0 "§S“But why not just kill me? Surely you see me as a threat? If I escaped, I could use the elements against you.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_73:0 "§O“Oh Twilight, you still see me as another version of Nightmare Moon. But we are nothing alike. Luna’s transformation was the result of petty jealousy. Mine was through an all-consuming need to protect my children.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_74:0 "§S“By killing any of your ‘children’ who defy you?”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_75:0 "§O“I will not deny that I have caused them pain.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_76:0 "§O“When it comes to leading a nation, you have to accept that the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_77:0 "§O“And that is why you’re here, because ponykind needs you, if only to temper the worst of my excesses.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_78:0 "§S“If you really cared about ponies, you would let them make their own choices and not kill those who disagree with you.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_79:0 "§O“DON’T YOU DARE QUESTION MY LOVE FOR THEM!”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_80:0 "§O“Ahem...”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_81:0 "§O“In your current state, you would only disrupt the careful order I have created. Rest assured, you will be released eventually. But not before I give you a few very valuable lessons.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_82:0 "§SSo that’s it. You’re hoping I will betray my friends?”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_83:0 "§O“No. I’m hoping you will use everything I have taught you to help me save them. Unfortunately, your cooperation is mandatory. You are too valuable to Equestria for me to give you freedom.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_84:0 "§O“I wish it didn’t have to be this way. You are the closest thing I’ve ever had to a daughter. But I can’t allow sentiment to cloud my judgement again.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_85:0 "§O“One way or another, you will serve the new order. You must make a decision. Please, choose the right one. If you refuse, I will be forced to take action.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_86:0 "§S“Enough with your threats! I will never turn my back on my friends and everything I believe in just to help you perpetuate this oppressive empire!”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_87:0 "§O“Admit it. You’re starting to doubt yourself. I can see it in your eyes.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_88:0 "§S“No! I won’t let you trick me! As soon as my friends come to rescue me, I will join them in defeating you. The friendship we share is stronger than anything else in the world!”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_89:0 "§S“You taught me that, a long time ago.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_90:0 "§S“I know you’re still in there, Celestia. I promise you, I haven’t given up yet.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_91:0 "§O“Save your breath. You’re not the first one to give me this spiel.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_92:0 "§S“No, you need to hear this. You need to know that we still love you and it’s not too late to turn back.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_93:0 "§O“Who says I want to turn back?”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_94:0 "§S“I know you do, deep down inside. The Celestia I knew would never condone the evil you’ve committed.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_95:0 "§O“Evil? That’s a bit harsh.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_96:0 "§S“How else would you describe your actions?”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_97:0 "§S“Necessary? How could what you’re doing possibly be necessary?”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_98:0 "§O“Ponykind is caught in a web of delusions and lies. They are unwilling to take the steps necessary to save themselves from certain destruction.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_99:0 "§O“I don’t take pleasure in what I must do. But I have no choice.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_100:0 "§O“I love my ponies too much to watch them die.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_101:0 "§S“But how do you know harmony would lead to our destruction when it has brought us so much peace and happiness?”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_102:0 "§O“Please, just look at the state of the world.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_103:0 "§O“In Griffonia, we are hated and exploited despite all that we have done for the continent.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_104:0 "§O“Some griffon nations have even taken to butchering entire pony families and towns simply because we had the audacity to exist!”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_105:0 "§O“Even our so-called ‘allies’ only work with us out of selfishness. Think about all the threats Equestria has faced. They did not lift so much as a hoof to help us.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_106:0 "§O“But now that I sit on the throne, the harmonist rebels have been flooded with foreign aid. They are fine with letting Tirek siphon us of magic, but not me subjecting their actions to a little scrutiny?”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_107:0 "§O“They could not be any more obvious.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_108:0 "§O“So with the world united against us, surely you can see that ponies need somepony to guide them in the right direction?”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_109:0 "§S“I... I suppose.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_110:0 "§S“But that doesn’t excuse what you’re doing to Equestria.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_111:0 "§O“Of course it doesn’t. But I will not stop just so ponykind can be subjected to an even worse fate.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_112:0 "§O“What I do is harsh. But it is necessary.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_113:0 "§O“Believe me, I wish ponykind could live in peace.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_114:0 "§O“They deserve all the happiness the world has to offer.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_115:0 "§O“But I don’t have that luxury. They may not be happy under my rule. But they will be safe. That’s all I want.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_116:0 "§O“I can tell that this information has disturbed you.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_117:0 "§S“No, I’m fine!”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_118:0 "§O“You forget that I practically raised you, Twilight. I know when you’re upset.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_119:0 "§O“It’s okay, Twilight. It can be hard to accept that some actions, though cruel, are ultimately necessary. Go, get some rest.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_120:0 "§S“Justice? How could any of the atrocities you’ve committed possibly be justice!?”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_121:0 "§O“At best, a dissenter is unknowingly putting ponykind’s existence at stake by preventing me from doing my job. At worst, they’re working with foreign powers to undermine the greatest hope our species has had in thousands of years.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_122:0 "§O“I only ask that ponies do what I know will give them the best chance of survival. Those that try to stop me are putting countless lives at risk with their actions.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_123:0 "§S“How does forcing us to obey you under threat of death improve our chances of survival?”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_124:0 "§O“Because if not for me, something worse would only exploit our weakness.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_125:0 "§O“We are surrounded by enemies, Twilight. They would not hesitate to crush us just because we dared to take our rightful place under the sun. They above all deserve the justice I will bring upon them.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_126:0 "§S“But that doesn’t excuse what you’re doing to Equestria.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_127:0 "§S“I’m not naive enough to believe that there aren’t creatures out there who would and probably have killed ponies without a shred of remorse. But there’s nothing just about killing innocents simply because they belong to one particular species.” §!"
 sol_dialogue_text_128:0 "§O“If those so-called ‘innocents’ were as pure as you described them, they would have tried to stop their countrymen from killing us.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_129:0 "§S“So you think death is the appropriate punishment for cowardice?”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_130:0 "§O“When it leads to the death of my children, yes.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_131:0 "§S“Then you clearly don’t understand the value of life.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_132:0 "§O“You test my patience, Twilight. Leave.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_133:0 "§O“So, have you reconsidered my offer?”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_134:0 "§S“I still won’t join you. Not after everything you’ve done.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_135:0 "§O“And why not? Do you truly see me as some sort of irredeemable monster?”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_136:0 "§S“Well, no...”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_137:0 "§S“But that doesn’t change the fact that what you’ve done to Equestria is wrong.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_138:0 "§S“Yes, because in doing so you’ve become just as bad as they are.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_139:0 "§O“You cannot defeat an enemy by pulling your punches. Peace and friendship does not beat order and aggression. At least my way gives us a fighting chance.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_140:0 "§S“But what’s the point in fighting a tyrant if you become just as bad to secure victory?”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_141:0 "§O“I hardly think I’m worse than Chrysalis or Sombra.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_142:0 "§S“Then consider my question a hypothetical.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_143:0 "§O“Survival would be my reason.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_144:0 "§O“If I was an ordinary pony forced to decide between supporting myself and a griffon or changeling tyrant, I would pick myself simply because I would rather be the oppressor instead of the oppressed.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_145:0 "§S“That hardly sounds fair.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_146:0 "§O“It isn’t. But in this world, it’s kill or be killed. If you had to kill to save your friends, you would.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_147:0 "§S“But you don’t even seem interested in looking for a third option.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_148:0 "§O“I’ve searched for that third option for a thousand years. I’m sick of looking.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_149:0 "§S“Then you just aren’t looking hard enough. There is good in every creature.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_150:0 "§O“Your optimism is nauseating.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_151:0 "§S“Perhaps. But I have yet to meet a creature of pure evil.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_152:0 "§O“They don’t have to be pure evil to destroy everything you’ve ever loved.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_153:0 "§S“But only a creature of pure evil can ever be beyond reasoning or friendship.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_154:0 "§O“I should warn you, tomorrow you will have to make a final decision. For the sake of Equestria, I hope you make the right one.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_155:0 "§O“Until we meet again, Twilight.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_156:0 "§O“Whether you like it or not, millions of ponies out there cheer my name. I know you have seen it. They want me. They fear what I might be, but they crave the order and stability that I promise. And they will fight for that promise.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_157:0 "§O“If you would break me, maybe even seal me in the Sun, what then? What do you plan to do with the countless millions who believe in me?”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_158:0 "§O“Will you break them as well? Will you strike down pony after pony whose only crime was believing in me? Will you create orphans out of fillies, destroy loving families and leave countless lovers to weep, just because they wanted a brighter future for Equestria?”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_159:0 "§O“Of course, you will be surrounded by ponies telling you it was the right thing to do. But in reality, they will hate you for stealing their future. For letting yet another civil war engulf Equestria.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_160:0 "§O“I've seen it, Twilight. Death and suffering on a scale this nation could not even begin to imagine. What I saw horrifies even me.” §!"
 sol_dialogue_text_161:0 "§S“I... I...”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_162:0 "§O“But it doesn’t have to be that way.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_163:0 "§O“You can choose to join me.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_164:0 "§O“Together, we can bring a new age for ponykind. One where they will be free from all threats, living in eternal peace and prosperity!”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_165:0 "§O“Twilight... if you truly believe in what I once taught you, then help me to once again save Equestria from calamity.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_166:0 "§S“Daybreaker... I...”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_167:0 "§O“It’s okay, Twilight. Tomorrow, I will summon you here. You can give me your answer then. I beg you, please make the right one.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_168:0 "§O“So, have you come to a decision?”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_169:0 "§S“Yes, I have. I...”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_170:0 "§S“I will join you.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_171:0 "§O“Oh Twilight, you don’t know how much it pleases me to hear that! I knew I could count on you, my eternally faithful student! I promise you, together we will create a brighter future for our nation!”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_172:0 "§S“Of course, your highness.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_173:0 "§O“Please, you may call me Daybreaker. I was not lying when I said I see you as the daughter I never had.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_174:0 "§S“That... that means a lot to me.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_175:0 "§S“Thank you, Daybreaker.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_176:0 "§O"Today is a day of new beginnings. The sun is rising, the future is within our grasp. Equestria is being reborn. And you will be reborn with it.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_177:0 "§O“Now rise and take your place at my side, Twilight Sparkle.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_178:0 "§S“Yes, I have.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_179:0 "§S“I refuse to be your tool.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_180:0 "§S“Celestia was like a mother to me. She was always there, guiding me towards true friendship. I know that if she was here, she would be telling me to refuse your ‘offer’.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_181:0 "§S“But I’m not just refusing for her sake. I’m refusing for the sake of my friends and all the ponies you brutalise under the guise of ‘protection’.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_182:0 "§S“Celestia might be gone. But I know that one day, she will return. Because I’m never going to give up on freeing her. No matter how long you keep me here, I will never bend to you!”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_183:0 "§O“How touching. Once more, I am plagued by the legacy of my past delusions.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_184:0 "§O“But you are missing one crucial piece of information, Twilight.”§!"
 sol_dialogue_text_185:0 "§O“You never had a choice.”§!"

I am to make the Crystal Empire bend it's knee to it's true, Solar Rulers- by whatever means necessary...\n\nMy only hope is that Shining and Cadence are reasonable in the face of the new regime; that they can be brought to see Daybreaker's light as I have. But, if they cannot... well...\n\nThat's why I am going, after all. I slid open my closet door with a quick and simple spell, and gazed at the three sets of clothing in the direct centre.

The barely a pony looked away from my superiority after a brief moment, though his gaze did betray his worry. Scorecard, I'd been told his name was. Not that I cared, much. Still, I had to at least pay some attention, if they were going to be successful.\n\nThe station itself was bustling with activity, though I, Sunrise Sparkle, ignored all of that. Instead, I looked for my quarry- an Crystal Guard. Mindful of the shocked and confused stares, and the guard's nervous gaze. He no doubt had spotted a few things. Firstly that I was Twilight Sparkle. Or was, rather, but he didn't need to know that. Secondly that I was in the company of a batpony and a couple other well-ragged ponies, clearly refugees. Thirdly, the well-battered and practically ancient .32 calibre revolver jammed in an equally ancient holster on my right hip.\n\nDeterminedly, I ignored the gazes and his wariness, and trotted up to the guard, using my magic to remove and levitate the pistol and belt away from my barrel- and careful not to knock loose my Kolibri hidden away within the rags. "I am here to seek asylum from the Illegitimate Solar Imperial Rule. Please, Sir, I need to see my brother and sister-in-law.""

"Oh my goodness, Twilight! I'm so glad that you're safe! Were you followed? Did they hunt you? Are you okay?"\n\nI wheezed slightly, as Cadence attempted to murder me by hugging, which she took for being a tad sickly, as she pressed a hoof to my forehead. "Cadence, I'm okayyyy, promise. Just a bit ragged, is all. We got out okay. I have no idea if we were followed." That seemed to ease her concern at least, as she led us to our rooms, to get cleaned up and food in our bellies."
 solarempiresparkles.41.d_susp:0 "The meeting took far too long to arrange, for my liking. Far, far too long for an asylum request. I would have to instruct Scorecard and his lackeys to be doubly careful with his preparations. Finally, I was allowed to enter the throne room, where my Sister-in-law was awaiting me. The tone was... cool, to say the least, but I could work with cool, if I had to.\n\nI gave Cadenza a respectful bow, from my position in front of her throne, as Scorecard and the twins did the same behind me. "Cadence, it's good to see you." I began, choosing my words carefully- she was already suspicious of me; being overly cold or overly honeyed with my words could blow my cover just as easily as being caught out as a spy. "I was starting to worry you wouldn't see me at all."\n\n"Yes, well... can't be too careful, after all. You'll have to pardon my concern, seeing as the guard who received you reported that you handed him a gun- I didn't even know you owned a gun, let alone had one. It's a relief to see you safe, though. Was your journey safe?"\n\n"It was... safe enough - as safe as something like that can get, in any case."\n\n"That is good to hear, at least.

That bit, at least, was true. Re-education would take a few moons, after all. I paused, taking a sip of my tea. "Luna has been... deposed of, to put things mildly."\n\nTo put them more firmly: she was gone. Permanently, this time.\n\nWhilst Cadence was stirring her own tea, trying to gather her thoughts, I chanced a gaze up to the wall clock- it'd been a couple hours.

 solarempiresparkles.6.d:0 "I heard the pounding on my door as I roused myself from my sleep and immediately realised what'd happened. That idiot bat pony had gotten himself caught and that meant I was burnt. Thinking quickly, I took my Kolibri pistol, and gazing about myself, grit my teeth as I lit up my horn. Risky, but necessary, I swallowed the minuscule weapon, feeling somewhat sickly as I choked it down my throat. Then, I cast a long ago learnt medical spell to stave off the effects of the onset lead poisoning for a full forty-eight hours. Long enough for me to exhume the weapon- preferably by mouth- later. I then put on my sleepiest face, and stumbled over to the door, opening it.\n\nAs I suspected, I was slammed quickly to the ground and placed in hoofcuffs, a horn bracket clamped at my horn's base to prevent magic.\n\n"Twilight Sparkle, you are under arrest for conspiracy of treason against the Crystal throne. If you resist, you shall be terminated with extreme prejudice."\n\n"Well sod you too, whatever your name is. Bloody wonderful thing to wake up to."\n\nA few hours of processing later, and I was in the dungeons, far below the castle itself. Ironic, in my opinion. Cadence and Shining had, of course, come down and given me the usual spiels, and I'd played the unrepentant zealot- which, to be fair, I probably am- and so I was left to my own devices. Waiting a few minutes to make sure I was fully alone, I moved to a dark corner of the room. I didn't have magic, but I still had a Kolibri, after all. It was all just about finding the proper time to break out, now."
 solarempiresparkles.6.a:0 "It was worth a try..."

 solarempiresparkles.15.t:0 "Execute"
 solarempiresparkles.15.d_susp:0 "There was a slight knock on the door, as Scorecard let himself in, closing and locking it behind him. He looked frustrated, as I gazed questioningly at the batpony from over my reading glasses. "Well?"\n\n"I was caught." He whispered softly, holding up a hoof to placate me. "I explained it away at being lost, but they're no doubt more suspicious. Nonetheless I did manage to get what I was looking for, so we have that going for us."\n\nI'd have said I expected better, but truthfully, I'd expected worse out of the barely a pony. "Very well. We'll go forward, cautiously. Give me a few hours to prepare; I'll find you." With a soundless nod, he turned about and left, locking the door back behind him. Just in case."
 solarempiresparkles.15.d:0 "I looked up from the book I'd been reading, as somepony knocked gently on the door. "It's open." I greeted neutrally, unsure of who was at the door. As the familiar face of Scorecard entered the room, shutting it behind him with a smile, I shut the book, and gave the stallion my full attention. "Well?"\n\n"Everything is ready. Should be smooth sailing from here on out, Sparkle." He stated softly as he walked over, careful not to give anything that he did not have to away, in case we were being spied upon.\n\n"Good to hear. I'll come find you when I'm ready, then. Good evening, Scorecard."\n\n"And you as well, Sparkle." And with a nod, he was gone, as I settled back into my reading. I'd give it a few hours, then go forward with the operation. Tonight was to be a night of swiftness and precision, and I needed time to prepare myself, mentally. Soon."

 solarempiresparkles.150.t:0 "Almost there"
 solarempiresparkles.150.d:0 "Scorecard placed a hoof against the wall of the hallway we were in. Tapping soundlessly against it to a rhythm he only knew- the rhythm of a guard's hoofsteps. A long, tense, second, then he gave me a fanged grin and nodded. I couldn't help but smirk back. Pathetic excuse for a pony he may have been, but he was damn good at his work. I'd have to request Daybreaker for further use of his services, once this was all over.\n\nThe four of us slunk into the next hall, and halted outside a particular room I'd known quite well. Princess Flurry Heart's bedroom. Hopefully, the filly would be sleeping quietly, and not raise quite a ruckus. I softly pushed the door open, and, as my eyes adjusted to the darkness, my breath died in my throat.\n\nFlash Sentry, a massive handcannon of some sort in on his hip, exhaled gently, moving his hoof away from the holster. "Jeez, Pr-Twilight. Scared me half to death."\n\nThis moronic idiot was guarding my Niece? Now I was doubly glad I was stealing her away. "Ah, apologies...Corporal?"\n\n"Er. Major, actually. Got a battlefield commission!"\n\n"Major? You are moving up in the world, Flash." I started to doubt the sanity of my brother - putting Flash Sentry in any position of responsibility?\n\n"Mind if I step in for a minute? I wanted to see Flurry Heart again..."\n\n"Oh, of course, your hi- ma'am. No reason you can't. You are her aunt after all. Just keep it down, she is sleeping."\n\nI flicked my gaze momentarily back to Scorecard, who nodded and fell back from the door, to explain to the twins, as I myself stepped inside, closing the door gently behind me. Almost mechanically, I lit a small light spell with my horn, cantering gently over. "It's been so long since I've seen her, it feels.""

"Twilight Sparkle's magic is magenta." He stated simply.\n\nI clicked my tongue, and turned about, slowly, so as not to provoke the stallion, maintaining my magical aura to avoid his suspicion. I didn't want to resort to my Kolibri- yet.\n\nInstead I used my magic to wrest the gun from his grip, as it discharged harmlessly into the ceiling. Flash closed the distance, slamming me into the ground, as the door to the room itself burst open. Jabbing a wing at my chest to expunge the breath from my lungs, his other tugged at a shrill- whistle, quickly brought to his mouth, as it sung out an alarm. A quick whip from Scorecard's Welrod, directly to Flash's head, knocked the stallion out, but the damage had already been done."

I quickly tossed my Kolibri out the open window above Flurry's bed, before letting my magic fall silent, holding my hooves up in surrender as Crystal Guards filled the room.\n\n"Twilight Sparkle of [This.GetNameDef], you are under arrest for plotting and attempted treason against the Crystal Crown, Espionage between two sovereign nations, and assuming Major Sentry does not survive, Murder. Do not resist."\n\nLike I had much of a choice."

 solarempiresparkles.18.d:0 "Thinking quickly, I stood to my hooves, and motioned for the other three to come close.

I wished for nothing more than to bring the holy ruination of my Empress' ruination down upon the Crystal Ponies. However, I had to remain calm and collected. The Crystal Guard would no doubt be looking for us, as Cadence's insistence, so time was of the essence. Quickly, I formed a spell Matrix, centred on Canterlot, and lit up my horn. At least we would escape to tell the tale."

I no doubt had a troubled smile on my face.\n\n"Oh, well, you see-" a quick flick of my horn, and the minuscule Kolibri- smallest developed pistol in the world, apparently, chirped four times, it's normally incredibly inaccurate 2.7mm rounds travelling the short journey from the barrel to Sentry's barrel, as he flopped back, down and out for the count. Scorecard and the twins burst in immediately, carrying their own holdout weapons, consisting of a stiletto, another Kolibri, and a Solar Imperial made Welrod. I chanced a look over to Flurry; still sleeping soundly, and levitated her over in my magic, dropping the Kolibri- it's job was over. After awaiting a tense moment to make sure I wasn't interrupted, the four of us bunched up, my magic bringing Flurry close to my barrel, and I began to cast my oft-used spell.\n\nA few matrices and we were safely home across the border, Hollow Shades' quiet farmhouses greeting us.

"Or are we to spill even more Equestrian Blood this century?"\n\nThe Cold Hearted Princess of the Frozen North scowled openly. "If that is what it comes to, then that is what it shall come to. Begone, Solar Witch, on penalty of death if you see fit to return."\n\nI opened my mouth to say something in response, heat rising from my belly to my now smouldering mane, restrained fury building behind my eyes, as the frosty air around me hissed and crackled from the sudden change of temperature. "Very Well." I growled, resisting the urge to smite the upstart empress where she stood - such were the gifts of the Sol Invicta. But, I bit my tongue, turned upon my hooves, and left, head held high, and eyes brimming with fury at the embarrassment."

 solarempiresparkles.27.d:0 ""In the interests of preventing any and all bloodshed between Equestrian ponies and other peoples, Her Highness Daybreaker of [This.GetNameDef] has sent me on her behalf, to negotiate a peace between our two peoples, if possible." I gave a low, respectful bow, as she allowed me to finish my request, before raising back up onto my hooves to gauge her reaction.\n\nThe mare considered it for several long moments, teeth chewing upon her lower lip, as she weighed her options. She gazed to me, then to the door, as if attempting to see [This.GetNameDef] in the distance, far behind me.\n\nCadence exhaled, letting her shoulders sag momentarily, before drawing herself back up into the regal figure she always presented herself as. "Very well, Twilight Sparkle. Let us negotiate, so that we may keep the peace between our nations. Follow me if you would, to a parlour I am having prepared for us. Do you have a preferred tea?"\n\n"Earl Grey, if you'd please." I replied, following her with a thin, neutral smile. I had a lot of work ahead of me, true, but perhaps Cadence would see the light, without destroying my family in the process."
 solarempiresparkles.27.a:0 "We shall see if my sister-in-law is sensible or not."

 solarempiresparkles.28.t:0 "Solar Demands"
 solarempiresparkles.28.d:0 "After much debate and back and forth arguing between our Princess Cadence and Twilight Sparkle- who is the diplomat representing the new Solar Imperial Regime- [This.GetNameDef]'s list of demands has been finalised for review by the Crystal Empress. Firstly, [This.GetNameDef] has commanded, as in prior years, that we in the Crystal Empire return to the Equestrian Fold as their puppet state. Secondly, we shall be allowed to keep the Empress Cadenza as our ruler, though she will as expected have less freedom, and shall be more like the puppet Princess that she was originally supposed to be. We must now make a choice on whether we shall bend the knee to Solarist designs or not."
 solarempiresparkles.28.a:0 "It is better to live on our knees than to die standing."

 solarempiresparkles.29.d:0 "I returned to the parlour with a quiet smile upon my face at Flurry's growth into a young mare, as I left her and Shining to their own devices, and I returned to Cadence and negotiations. \n\nCadence seemed conflicted as I re-entered the room, though I declined to mention it, letting her bring up her thoughts on her own terms. "I believe, Twilight, that our negotiations are coming to a close... After reviewing Daybreaker's terms, I have decided to agree unconditionally. You may return to her at your leisure, though you are always welcome to stay."\n\nMy smile widened slightly, as Cadence and I shared a hug, and I took a seat anyways. "Between you and me, Cadence, I think I need some time to relax. Mind if I stay for a cup of tea or two?"\n\n"Not at all, Twilight," She smiled in return, as I raised my cup of tea, warming it with my magic. "Not at all." With Diplomacy off our minds, we could finally return to chatting about normal things, and good times, past and present. Like we were a normal family, again."
 solarempiresparkles.29.a:0 "And, with a hopeful wish, maybe we could be one again."

 solarempiresparkles.30.t:0 "Opportunity"
 solarempiresparkles.30.d:0 "I nearly screeched aloud as I exited the parlour for a mind-clearing walk. I held it in, of course, as befitting a mare of my occupation and standing, but Daybreaker herself, it was tempting. I'd been debated into a standstill by Cadence over the past week, to the point I was ready to rip my own mane out and eat it. To call her stubborn would be an insult to the Obstinate and mule-headed everywhere. For the past two days, we'd gone nowhere, arguing back and forth and back and forth about the Empire's eventual accession back into [This.GetNameDef]. And, by extension, Cadence's flat refusal to do so.\n\nFlapping my wings in frustration, I made my way to the Royal Garden- a poor mockery of the Canterlot Garden, though that was to be expected from a poor mockery of a proper Empire. Still, I could use the change in pace to gather my thoughts. Making my way to the central pond- kept liquid by permanent heating spells that kept it at a nice moderate seventy-two degrees Fahrenheit-  I paused, as I watched Flurry Heart playing with my brother, and her father - Shining Armor."

Here, Flurry, I can teleport us to your room, that should make it quick."\n\n"Oh, that's okay Auntie, I can teleport myself, thank you!" And with a flash, she was gone. I blinked, then shrugged, looking to Shining.\n\n"That's impressive for her age. How's things?"\n\n"Well enough, I suppose.. how are the negotiations going?"\n\n"Ugh. I'm trying to relax, Shiny. You're keeping her in the dark?"\n\n"Just until we get it all sorted out, one way or another.

She went to put away her gear, and I went about drawing a spell matrix. She returned, somewhat confused as I hit her with a strong sleep spell, before she was able to say anything. I exhaled. That was easier than I'd hoped. Turning to the door, I locked it, and levitated Flurry's somewhat weighty body over to my own. She'd forgive me eventually. The task done, I planted myself within the spell matrix, and lit up my horn. Next stop? [SOL.Capital.GetName]."

 solarempiresparkles.34.d:0 "I stepped proudly off the Solar Imperial express train, flanked by veteran inquisitors to my left and right. I myself stood squarely in the centre of the formation, the robes and finery of my station as Grand Solar Inquisitor catching in the winter breeze, as I swept my gaze across the gathered guards. I smiled, widely, a territorial and unfriendly smile. "Greetings, my good mares and stallions. We've an appointment with Her Highness, Mi Amore Cadenza. You will take us to her, post-haste."\n\nWithin minutes, we were being lead through the doors of the castle itself, a cadre of Crystal Guards surrounding us, carrying very real and very loaded rifles, at parade rest. Not even worth the effort to dispatch them, really, if it came to blows. It'd take... perhaps fifteen seconds; eight if I actually cared enough to focus on them.\n\nCadenza seemed shocked, as I made my way towards her throne, until I was ordered to stop by the guards. \n\n"I come bearing a message from Our Empress, Daybreaker: She Who Raises The Sun, Sol Invicta, the Dawn Hammer, True Goddess of this mortal world, may she reign eternally." I bowed, formally, as I presented my ruler's titles to Cadenza. After the requisite time passed, I returned to my standing position, and my Solar-touched gaze met that of Mi Amore Cadenza's - for the first time since I'd arrived, as I relished in her fear and uncertainty. "Her message is as follows: you shall return you and your ponies to our Solar Fold," I paused, to ensure I had her full attention, and that she fully understood my ultimatum."

 solarempiresparkles.35.d:0 "I gazed in utter shock as Twilight- no, Sunrise Sparkle; The Twilight I knew was clearly dead and gone- marched her way into the throne room, her contingent of Solar Imperial Inquisitors surrounded by guards, and haughtily proclaimed to bow immediately to Daybreaker's rule or perish. Unholy fires blazed behind her eyes, as she proclaimed her Empress' rule, and I bit my tongue momentarily as she awaited my response. Steeling myself, I obliged the Solar Witch."
 solarempiresparkles.35.a:0 "We have no choice but to agree - lest they make true on their threats."

Be gone, harlot, and do not return."\n\nI wanted nothing more than to smite the insolent whelp where she stood. It would be a boringly easy task. A simple flick of the horn, and she would be naught but ash upon holy fire burnt ground.\n\nBut, Daybreaker's orders had been clear. My mane smouldered, as the odour of Sulphur bloomed in the air, and I grit my teeth. "Very well, you miserable excuse for an alicorn. Your chance was given. Now the blood of your peoples falls upon your hooves." And with my words spoken, I turned upon my hooves, surrounded by my loyal inquisitors and the Crystal Guard, and headed back towards the train. War would come, and war would come soon. And then Cadence would know the true ruination of Daybreaker's Holy Sun."

Some of them are large enough to sustain sizable thestral population. We should "encourage" resettlement and help them build new cities. We are in no way giving up on our citizens, it will simply be much easier to watch over them. We will have our inquisitors work in these new cities and educate thestrals. These new cities might even develop into new industrial centers in time. Naturally, at first there might be some dissent against this idea but eventually they will come to see it is for the best.

They will round up all the thestrals and do what must be done. It may not seem right at the moment, but they will inevitably pose a threat to stability of our Empire in future. We will not stop until every single bat has been hunted down and defeated. We must steal away our hearts and do what must be done for preservation of stability within our Empire.

I drove away the thing that sought to cast the world into eternal night, and for a thousand years I have guided you to prosperity.\n\nDo you imagine that you would have prospered without me? That the Three Tribes on their own could have sealed away Discord? Could you have fought Sombra or Tirek? Could you have brought down Nightmare Moon on your own? Or would you have been broken and subjugated several times over?\n\nYou would not. Equestria exists because of me, YOU exist because of me, and no longer shall I sit silently in obscurity to let lesser ponies take the credit for the nation's prosperity! You have been spoiled for centuries, and now your ruler calls upon you to give her the worship she is due.\n\nBow before me, mortals, for the true queen - nay empress - of these lands will no longer sit in silence. She to whom you owe all will now claim her rightful place as your Empress and your Goddess! Bow before me, let the world tremble at my brilliance, and let all ponies worship their rightful mistress!"

 solarempire.46.t:0 "The Errant Student"
 solarempire.46.d:0 "Brought before Daybreaker in chains, Twilight Sparkle stood in front of the throne, staring into the floor instead of up at the radiant being seated on the Solar Throne before her. She was utterly silent, and from her half-hidden expression she was ready to remain so for hours if needed. \n\n"My faithful student..." Daybreaker began only to be cut off.\n\n"Don't say that!" Twilight snapped in anger. "You... you're not her."\n\n"I am more than she ever was, my faithful student." Daybreaker replied, descending from her throne. "Tell me... could Celestia keep you safe from the Changelings? Could she stop Tirek? Or Sombra? Tell me, how many ponies suffered because of Celestias, of MY, weakness? How many times did she fail, and what was the price?"\n\n"Shut up!" Twilight screamed, tears running down her face as she tore at the chains, trying to get free.\n\n"No, I will not. Because you are going to listen, and you are going to learn. You cannot help but learn after all, my faithful student, and right now your eagerness to learn will have to trump your pride.""
 solarempire.46.a:0 "You will listen, and you will learn."

 solarempire.47.t:0 "The Faltering Student"
 solarempire.47.d:0 ""A new order is rising in Equestria, Twilight." Daybreaker told the chained pony before her. "Whether you like it or not, countless ponies out there cheer my name and adore me. You have seen it, haven't you? They want me. They fear what I might be, but they adore what I promise, and they will fight for that promise. We've taught them well, haven't we?" Daybreaker asked with a smirk.\n\n"You're telling them lies!" Twilight snapped back at her. "You traded Harmony for Oppression! You cast aside Friendship in favour of Subjugation!"\n\n"Really?" Daybreaker asked. "Tell me, when your friend Pinkie Pie fell into depression, did you not defy her wishes to be left alone because you knew what was the best for her? Have you not humbled Rainbow Dash many times when she forgot her place? Have you not used subterfuge to deal with your enemies, be they dragons, ponies or other creatures, all for the greater good?"\n\n"I sought to get through to them, help them grow as people, not subjugate them!"\n\n"Oh really, but what does that make you currently?" Daybreaker asked, getting in close to Twilight's face and staring her down. "You have seen how ponies cheer my name and how they fall in line under me, praising the strength and the security I give them. What of them, Twilight? Will you fight them as well? Will you stand in the ruins of Manehattan, or Ponyville, or Baltimare? Will you strike down pony after pony whose only crime was believing in me? Will you create orphans out of fillies, destroy loving families and leave countless lovers to weep, all because they did not obey your ideals?""
 solarempire.47.a:0 "Is that not what you would condemn me for doing?"

 solarempire.48.t:0 "The Breaking Student"
 solarempire.48.d:0 ""If you would break me, maybe even seal me in the Sun, what then? When you ascend the throne, or maybe even shove Luna onto it, will you bear that burden? Having thousands whisper silently, when no one else can hear, of how you brought down Tartarus itself upon those who believed in the princess that finally became a queen. It would be called the right thing, of course it would, you will force it to be called so... but you will be hated, more than anyone else... and you wouldn't do it because of your love for your friends, but because you sought to twist the world to your liking."\n\n"I... I..."\n\n"Twilight..." Daybreaker said, her voice turning from imperious to beckoning. "You do not have to do that. You can choose. You can choose to say "enough". You can choose to say to all those who want to harm Equestria that they can try, but that they will suffer the consequences. And yet instead you would start a civil war, a civil war where how many ponies will die? Where how much death and pain will be wrought because you were so arrogantly confident you knew best? And in doing so... How are you different from me, or rather what you think I am?\n\nBut you can choose. You can see what I offer my little ponies and have faith. You can join me, hope to temper my worst excesses and transform what you've learned into a new age, an age you will help me shape, where Equestria will still have peace and prosperity instead of being torn asunder by war and death. Twilight... if you truly believe in what I once taught you, then help me to once again save Equestria from calamity."\n\nTwilight didn't say anything, only staring at the floor as her defiance slowly left her. Though she didn't see it, Daybreaker smirked where she stood, towering over the slowly breaking mare."
 solarempire.48.a:0 "Equestria is being reborn, and so will you... now rise and serve me; Sunrise Sparkle."
