When Daybreaker had declared the birth of the Solar Empire, they had rebelled.

They would work with the republicans, but Luna knew they would rather be following the orders of her darker alter ego.

She had no idea how to play a careful political balancing act all while leading a nation to victory.

If we remain a rag-tag group of militias fighting with guerilla tactics, Daybreaker will simply pick us off one by one. To create one united army, we shall call a conclave of our most experienced commanders and appoint a Commander-In-Chief who will be in charge of determining our nation's doctrine and craft our warfare style to their will. Four candidates have been presented before us, each representing powerful factions within our rebellion.\n\nFirst is Marshal Speck. Speck has received the most conventional military training out of the four candidates and favors warfare similar to the fledgling Equestrian army, with planning and logistics being essential for its conduct. He is favoured by the thestral traditionalists.\n\n[nlr_warmaster_second_desc]\n\nThird is General Caltrop Deekay. Much like Selenite, Deekay's doctrine is rooted in the reality of modern war, but approaches it from a different direction. Deekay says that the weapon that shall win the wars of the second millennium is the tank. She cites her own experiences fighting in the December Revolution and numerous conflicts fought across Griffonia as proof that mobile warfare is the definitive means to secure a quick and bloodless victory over a numerically superior enemy. Deekay is favoured by the harmonist old guard.\n\nLast comes Midnight Oil. He bluntly declares that the Empire has two resources that it can use to emerge victoriously: It's large supply of ponypower, and its near unrivalled industrial capacity. He has combined this with his own theories about the nature of warfare regarding large front operations. Some call his doctrines barbaric. He calls them effective. Midnight Oil is favoured by the Nightmare cultists."

If their lines broke, there would be nothing stopping the sun fetishists from cutting a bloody path to the city beyond. But Moonlight Sonata refused to let that happen.\n\nHer hooves darted over the soft mud and shifting rocks, barely avoiding rubble and remains from whatever mess was being thrown around by the artillery shells. How easy it would be to fly over it all, were it not for the guns that would make mincemeat out of any creature in their path. She pushed the thought of being gutted out of her head, gritted her teeth and continued running to the FOB.\n\nIt was gone. The whole structure had collapsed in on itself after a lucky shell had gone straight into the middle of the sandbags and detonated an ammunition cache. Just like that, their last line to the other militias had been destroyed.\n\n“No... No! This can’t be it!” The poor soldier cried out.\n\nShe dashed to what was left of the structure, over the piles of splintered wood and mutilated bodies in the search for anything that could be used to send the orders. The guttural cries of the dying hung over the batpony like the sun over her head as she redoubled her search. Finally, buried beneath a pile of debris, she found it. A functioning radio, covered in dust but still humming with magical energy.\n\nMoments later, Moonlight had collapsed on the ground. Her work was done, the message had gone through.
