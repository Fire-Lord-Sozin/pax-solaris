 SOL_LIGHTNING_DESC:0 "Lightning Dust began her career in aviation as a Wonderbolts trainee where she proved herself a dedicated but reckless flyer, eventually being dismissed after a stunt accident. Refusing to give up, she formed the Washouts out of other rejected candidates. When the war broke out, Lightning Dust abandoned her career as a stunt flyer to join the air force along with the rest of the Washouts, claiming it was her patriotic duty to fight for her homeland. Under her leadership, the Washouts became one of the most famous bomber squadrons in the air force.\n\nShe was later shot down over enemy territory and sent to a labour camp where she was tortured, starved and left to die. After months of suffering with only her festering hatred for company, Lightning Dust realised her true calling; to mercilessly annihilate every possible threat to Equestria so that no pony would every have to experience the same torment. When her camp was finally liberated by the Imperial Army, Lightning Dust resumed her command over the Washout Squadron. Her brutal and ruthless policies won her the fear and respect of the Imperial Air Force, eventually earning a special commendation from Empress Daybreaker herself.\n\nNow that the Solar Empire has defeated the changelings, Lightning Dust has finally been given the chance to enact her vengeance as the administrator of the Vraks Pacification Zone. Under her rule, the changelings live their lives in perpetual fear, knowing that it is only her obligation to Empress Daybreaker that keeps Lightning Dust from living up to her name and carpet bombing every hive until there is nothing left but ash and dust.\n§YPortrait By§!: Tsitra360"
