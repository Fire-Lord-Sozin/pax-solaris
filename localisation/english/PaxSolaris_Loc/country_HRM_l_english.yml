 EAW_WS_HRM:0 "[Root.GetNameDef] - The Great Revolution"
 EAW_WS_HRM_desc:0 "A fire rages in the cradle of ponykind. Across Equestria, ponies take up arms to fight the war that will decide the fate of §eDaybreaker’s§! nascent empire. The red and blue of banners of the §SHarmony Restoration Movement§! fly over the plains of the eastern seaboard, calling for all species to unite against one of the greatest threats to liberty the world has ever seen. Their cries are answered by millions, from the dissidents spread out across Equestria to the exiles in Griffonia and sympathisers in the Riverlands.\n\nMany have already taken to calling this revolution the §SWar of the Eclipse§!. For those who fight for harmony, this name is a promise that even the sun can be darkened. These ponies have not lost their thirst for freedom and will fight bravely to free their homelands from the taint of the corrupted alicorn.\n\nFrom democratic socialists to conservative republicans, the brave fighters of the H.R.M. have converged, risking their lives to gather on the plains of the §YEquestrian East Coast§!. They raise their rifles in staunch defiance of the §eSolar Empire§!, prepared to face down endless legions for the §Sliberation of ponykind§!. Even with the anti-Daybreaker resistance plagued with infighting and opportunistic ideologues willing to use the chaos to seize their moment, these freedom fighters are ready to answer the silent pleas of all ponies forced to live under solar oppression. They will create a new Equestria, one governed by the common ponies instead of manical alicorns or die trying.\n\nRevolutionary leaders §SStarlight Glimmer§! and §CTrixie Lulamoon§! now face the greatest challenge of their lives as the full might of §eDaybreaker’s§! legions bear down upon them. While they believe that the victory of harmony over tyranny is inevitable, the more pessimistic among their ranks tell a different story. They point to the uncomfortably large number of ponies who willingly follow Daybreaker and fear that her influence over ponykind will never truly be erased.\n\nWorse still is the looming cloud of fear that hangs over the heads of harmony’s faithful. They fear that if Daybreaker proves victorious, ponykind will not get another chance to rebel before they grow accustomed to their shackles."

The same army that had laid waste to entire nations.\n\nShe jerked up as a hoof was laid on her back and turned to find Trixie Lulamoon giving her a concerned look.\n\n“Hey, chin up. This has been a glorious victory!”\n\n“I know. It’s just...” Starlight lowered her head. “This is a gamble, and the odds aren’t in our favour. I fear we’ve only stuck our necks out for Daybreaker to stomp on them.”\n\nTrixie frowned slightly and pulled Starlight closer, pointing out the window. “Look outside. Do you see those buildings? Each one is filled with colts and fillies who will grow up free from Daybreaker’s tyranny, all thanks to the Great and Powerful Trixie, and her brilliant assistant of course.”\n\n“And what if we lose?” Starlight twisted away, unable to look for a moment longer. “What happens then?”\n\n“Why waste time pondering hypotheticals?” Trixie retorted. “Somepony had to step up and show the world that Daybreaker is not all-powerful, and I don’t see Twilight Sparkle rising to the occasion. Our actions today will show ponykind that these solarists can be defeated. Even if we lose, the truth behind our resistance will live on in the hearts of millions everywhere.”\n\n“Thanks, Trixie,” Starlight managed to force a weak smile.\n\n“Now let’s get going,” Trixie stepped forward with a flourish, dragging Starlight behind her."

They were quite something. There was only one problem; none of their manufacturers would be able to make this. He sure as Tartarus couldn’t and neither could anypony else in the shop. They had been car mechanics and had only recently manufactured the simplest bolt-action designs out of necessity. This was not a step they were ready to take.\n\n“Look, Flaxseed, I don’t mean to be rude but… we can’t make these. We don’t have the equipment or the expertise. Sure, I could try and put together a production line with Oily, but the guns would be about as functional Daybreaker’s government,” The stallion eventually managed. “I’m sorry, but this just isn’t possible for us, and I suspect it won’t be for most other manufactures.”\n\n“You don’t have a choice. They’ve got tanks, Nut! If we can’t make these guns, the H.R.M. doesn’t stand a chance!” His old friend replied.\n\n“How reassuring. I’m certain that making a barely-working rifle will help us against those.” Oily Hooves gave out dejectedly.\n\n“I… I know it looks bad, but there’s still hope.

This thin booklet listed all the other major anti-Daybreaker resistance movements in Equestria, and the unicorn couldn’t help but feel disappointed. It would seem a lot of ponies didn’t see Daybreaker as enough of a threat to put aside their petty rivalries.\n\n[hrm_3_first_paragraph]\n\n[hrm_3_second_paragraph]\n\nWith some support from the HRM, the other resistance groups could prove useful in the struggle against [EQS.GetNameDef].

Next were the Los Pegasus Authority, a paramilitary group led by ‘Generalissimo’ Pine Chest. His efforts were backed by the deposed nobles and industrialists forced to flee Daybreaker’s purges. They were well-funded and would keep the solarists occupied in western Equestria, but Starlight feared Pine Chest’s puppet masters wouldn’t be content with just the west coast."

 hrm_3_second_paragraph_thestrals_pacified:0 "And then there were the thestrals. Starlight couldn’t help but feel annoyed at the thought of them. With the return of Luna, they had begrudgingly accepted Daybreaker’s rule. Few were happy with the arrangement, but even fewer were willing to jeopardise the safety of the alicorn they worshipped to support jingoistic fringe movements. The remnants of the Ayacachtli Reclamation League would fight Daybreaker to the bitter end, but they were too weak to open a new frontline."
 hrm_3_second_paragraph_thestrals_available:0 "None of them could even hold a candle to the evil of the Ayacachtli Reclamation League. Their ‘Achtonkatl’, a thestral by the name of Itzli Yaotl, was as disagreeable as they come. She and Trixie had hoped the threat of Daybreaker would help unite the thestrals with the other three tribes, but it seems the alicorn had only made the resentment the thestrals hold for the rest of ponykind greater. Yaotl had agreed to work with Starlight, but there was something about the mare that unnerved her. Her eyes were cold and rotten, the eyes of a pony who had surrendered their soul to hatred. That made her dangerous, but potentially very useful."

They were burning through ammunition and food at an unprecedented rate. Worse, the solarists had destroyed thousands of factories as they retreated from the east in a final act of spite, leaving them with little means to produce their own equipment. Starlight and Trixie had convened to devise a solution, but none of their options were particularly desirable.\n\n“Something has to change, and soon,” Starlight frowned as she surveyed the map of the continent. “It won’t be long before we run out of bullets for the frontline, never mind the vehicles.”\n\n“Then we need action. I understand why you are opposed to requisitioning what we need by force, but we don’t really have any other options,” Trixie asserted, tapping the map for emphasis. “Propaganda and charity won’t cover our needs.”\n\n“But it will help take the strain off us, hopefully long enough for the engineers to get the factories running again,” Starlight replied. She sighed, rubbing her tired eyes with the back of her hoof. “Putting aside my feelings on the matter, surely you fear what these requisitions would do to our reputation? That was one of the first things Daybreaker did when she took power. If we start following in her hoofsteps, ponies might decide she wasn’t all that bad.”\n\nTrixie gave Starlight a pained smile. “Then we face that problem when it arises. I don’t like pinning our survival on getting those factories working, but if you think voluntary collections are the way to go, I’m right behind you.”\n\nStarlight paused for a moment, carefully weighing her options. After a while, she nodded. Neither choice was perfect, but she’d made her decision."

Their initial light tank design, the Breezie, was very fast, but poorly armed and armoured.
