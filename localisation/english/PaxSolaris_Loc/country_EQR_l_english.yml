 solrokenhardesc:0 "Rokenhar had always been a competent civil servant, perfectly content with the repetitive, paper-pushing routine of his daily duties. He had risen to the position of Mayor of Las Pegasus, a position that, until recently, required very few actual skills beyond being able to make the occasional public speech. The enormous, entrenched, immovable inertia of the ancient Equestrian bureaucracy took care of practically all of the actual work. His job may not have been stimulating, but it was as peaceful as the tired old stallion could hope for.\n\nUnfortunately for Rokenhar, that peace was not to last. The rise of Daybreaker came as a shock to them all. In the span of a single day the system he served had vanished, replaced by tyranny and militarism. Opposition to these changes sprang up almost as quickly, with the Las Pegasus harmonists all but forcing Rokenhar into the position of leading the revolution against Daybreaker.\n\nWith the might of the Solar Empire now turned against him, Rokenhar faces the most difficult challenge of his career. Will harmony prevail, or will the Republic of Equestria be the first nation to lie broken at Daybreaker’s hooves?"
