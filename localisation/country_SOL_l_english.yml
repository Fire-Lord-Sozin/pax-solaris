She awoke to find her house had been destroyed by a hurricane, yet the winds had not disturbed a single hair on her coat. She gave birth soon after and named her child Hurricane after the storm that heralded his birth.\n\nLike all children of the Pegasi Empire, Hurricane entered the rigorous education and training program mandated by the state the moment his wings could lift him off the ground. As Commander he would lead the Pegasi Empire to dominance over both Equus and Griffonia, laying low the griffon kingdoms and conquering as far south as modern-day Nimbusia. His conquests would open the pathway for the other tribes to settle Griffonia, using the land conquered by the pegasi in exchange for regular tribute as was custom at the time.\n\nBut the Pegasi Empire’s glory was not to last. The tension between the tribes and wars fought by Commander Hurricane had drawn the attention of the ancient and malevolent Windigos. With the temperature dropping rapidly, Commander Hurricane was forced to take his people south into modern Equestria. But the cold would not relent. With no other option, Commander Hurricane entered an uneasy alliance with Princess Platinum and Chancellor Puddinghead, an alliance that would lead to their subordinates discovering the fires of friendship and the foundation of the first unified pony nation.\n\n§YPortrait By:§!

Having worked since the first days of Daybreaker’s ascension, they used misdirection, deceit and - at times - simple ruthlessness to evade the Imperial Inquisition.\nThough their friendship is a tempestuous one, it has remained steadfast, and they have learned to play off each other. Starlight Glimmer has established herself as the strategist and the planner whereas Trixie has become (in)famous as an able tactician and guerilla commander. Their unorthodox backgrounds have informed their methods, and they managed to carry their efforts this far through these tricks.\nIt takes more than just tricks to lead a rebel army, however, and beyond the trickery and creativity stands two mares who, when all other heroes seemed to have failed, saw themselves called to step up and take over the fight.

And after a year of living in tents and hastily constructed homeless shelters, Pear Jam finally returned to his homecity to find a house waiting for him.

A year ago, it would have dominated the skyline. Changelings everywhere would look to it and be filled with pride. The tower still dominated the skyline, but now it sagged to one side like a withered tree. Flags of white and green were replaced by red and gold. Now it would only remind the Changelings of Vesalipolis who their new masters were.\n\nAs the ponies marched through the streets, Changelings were forced from their homes and made to kneel as they passed. Heading the march was Empress Daybreaker herself, standing proud atop a tank with a wicked smile on her face. To her, it wasn’t enough to defeat the Changelings. They had to be brought low and made to learn their place in the world.\n\nBeneath the shadow of the Queen’s Tower Daybreaker had gathered every Changeling of note.

The Palace itself was barely standing, the last symbol of a people's dreams of revolution.

And Luna wouldn’t get a third chance to breathe life into it. What was that old saying? Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, I’ll burn the flesh from your bones. That probably wasn’t right, but Daybreaker doubted the handful of Luna’s supporters that still clung to life would call her saying inaccurate.\n\nThe moon hung over the city. It shone weakly, for it was nothing but a pale reflection of her radiant sun. Just like Luna had been to her. It was a pity her sister could never see that and instead sought respect and love she never deserved. Daybreaker ignited her horn and the moon began to shift, dipping below the horizon to be replaced by the sun. Under the golden light of dawn, the vast number of ponies gathered at the city plaza were clearly visible. They had gathered at his spot all those months ago when Luna had shown her true colours.

Some cheered with jubilation, eager to be free from the shadow-king’s enslavement once again. Others maintained cautious fear. A handful peeked through the cracks in their curtains to watch Daybreaker pass. They hid from the sunlight like the rodents they were. Daybreaker would remember them.\n\nShe levitated the Crystal Heart with her magic, placing it back in its rightful spot at the center of the city.

Celestia’s letter had been brief, only telling Sunset that she wanted to make amends. It all seemed too good to be true. Why would Celestia offer her long-sought forgiveness after so many years of silence?\n\nHer first warning had been stepping out of the mirror and finding herself in the Canterlot Palace instead of Ponyville. But Sunset dismissed her worries. Perhaps Twilight had moved the portal to a more secure location? Stepping out into the halls, Sunset was met with soldiers dressed in black, red and gold marching under an unfamiliar crimson and gold banner. She raised an eyebrow. Twilight had spoken about escalating tensions forcing Celestia to take more extreme measures to preserve her nation, but surely Equestria couldn’t have changed this much?\n\nUnease gave way to dread when Sunset laid eyes on the domineering monolith of gold and red that had replaced Celestia’s simple throne. Through the wall of fire that shielded the throne, Sunset could just make out the silhouette of an alicorn. Gulping nervously, Sunset approached the throne and kneeled respectfully, averting her eyes.\n\n“Ah, Sunset Shimmer,” A voice boomed, seeming to come from everywhere at once. “My former student, returning home after so many years. I trust you know why I’ve summoned you?”\n\nSunset could feel Celestia’s aura dominating the throne room, shrouding everything in an oppressive heat. It terrified her, but she steeled her nerves and rose from her bow. “Princess Celestia, the last time we saw each other I was your snide little pupil who betrayed and abandoned you. I come before you, a changed pony, humbly asking for your forgiveness.”\n\nThe oppressive heat faded away, replaced by a comforting warmth that reminded Sunset of long summers spent under the princess' wing. Those days seemed so long ago. Seconds ticked by in tense silence while Celestia considered her words. But after what felt like ages, Celestia spoke.\n\n“What you did was tantamount to treason, Sunset. But fate has forced me to look upon my actions from a... different perspective. And I now realise that I was not entirely blameless for what transpired. You have my forgiveness, Sunset Shimmer. I only wish that you will grant me yours.”\n\n“Yes! Yes, of course!” Sunset cried.

And when Celestia smiled, Sunset had never spotted fangs.\n\n“You are surprised by my appearance,” The creature stated, stepping closer to Sunset. Hearing Celestia’s voice come from that mouth was disturbing. Sunset shivered as the alicorn lifted her wing and wrapped it around her, giving the unicorn a motherly smile.\n\n“I cannot blame you. Equestria has changed since you left. I have changed. When the enemies of ponykind conspired against us, I decided enough was enough. If they could not accept our friendship, then they would be shown our wrath. But the one thing that hasn’t changed is the love I feel for my little ponies. Especially you, Sunset.”\n\nThose words filled Sunset with a warm fuzzy feeling. She couldn’t help but lean into the soft feathery wings wrapped around her. But the sight of flaming hair brought everything into sharp clarity. She pulled herself out of the embrace and glared up at the alicorn who was still smiling at her with Celestia’s face. \n\n“No more lies! Tell me what you have done with Celestia or I’ll beat it out of you!”\n\nMelodic laughter filled the room. “Oh Sunset, I cannot blame you for thinking me a liar. I have lied to you before. The truth is, I am not Celestia. I am and always have been Daybreaker! Celestia was nothing more than the lie I lived for a thousand years, the lie I forced upon Equestria and forced upon you.”\n\nSunset didn’t know what to think. This creature looked like Celestia. She smiled like Celestia. And she spoke the words Sunset had spent years desperately wanting to hear from Celestia. Sunset slowly let her guard down.\n\n“This lie blinded me to my many mistakes,” Daybreaker continued. “Mistakes like letting my nation grow weak and vulnerable, sacrificing our safety in the hopes that others would do the same. Mistakes that I am now trying to rectify. And that is why I brought you here. Banishing you was one of my greatest mistakes. I hope that you will accept my apology.”\n\nDaybreaker opened her wings wide, her wrathful eyes somehow shining with a maternal kindness just like they always had. The last of Sunset’s resolve crumbled.

Good work!”\n\nThe unicorn filly giggled and hugged her brother tightly. She couldn’t take all the credit. Miss Cheerilee was a great teacher, she taught them everything from that orange book the nice soldiers had given her so well. After that the questions were easy!\n\nHer answer to the first question (Explain the rise of the Reformisten Movement) was so obvious: because they’re griffons and griffons hate ponies! Pumpkin Cake wouldn’t admit it to her brother because he’d just tease her, but the video that Cheerilee had shown them about Griffons had really scared her.\n\nThe rest of the test was just as easy. ‘Question 4: Why did the Griffon Empire collapse?’ had been answered with ‘only ponies are capable of friendship’ while ‘Question 7: Why did the Griffons help Chrysalis rise to power?’ was answered with ‘because they’re jealous of ponies!’. Pumpkin considered herself lucky she got such a good education. The Buffalo weren’t even taught how to read! How awful was that? Pound Cake was an icky colt and even he could read. Empress Daybreaker should just conquer them so they could learn to read too!\n\nA few of the other colts showed up and beckoned for Pound Cake to join them in a game.

Instead, Daybreaker smiled. “A princess is a title for a pony incapable of protecting her nation. You would be wasted in such a position.

Her aides have proposed three options for attacking her old policies:\n\n1) Many ponies criticised Celestia’s hooves-off approach to governing because they believed it allowed for an entrenched upper class to emerge and stifle progress. Attacking from an authoritarian angle could convince ponies Daybreaker’s changes are a chance to resolve a long-lasting class divides.\n\n2) Equestria under Celestia was notoriously pacifistic, resulting in a weak military with outdated technology. Attacking from the militarist angle could convince ponies they weren’t safe under Celestia but will be under Daybreaker.\n\n3) Towards the end of Celestia’s reign there were continued fears over foreigners entering Equestria.

Our most important outposts in the area remain untouched but it is only a matter of time before the buffalo become brave enough to attack those too. Something must be done.\n\nTwo proposals sit on Daybreaker’s desk. One suggests withdrawing from most of the buffalo land and concentrating on our most important outposts. This would mean we would only have nominal control over buffalo lands and give the buffalo the opportunity to aid the resistance (especially in the event of an uprising) but would be the cheapest option and wouldn't burden our military. The other suggests gathering the buffalo into work camps overseen by the military. Our military will monitor the detained buffalo around the clock and use them as hostages to pacify the buffalo our search parties might have missed. However, this would add additional burden to our military. The buffalo would be unable to assist the resistance unless the resistance managed to send agents to liberate them.\n\nOf course there are tentative suggestions of a third solution to the buffalo question.

 paxsolaris.27.d:0 "Elder Hardhooves strained her aching legs and pulled another cart of sand from the deep pit. She felt faint under the heat of the scorching sun, but if even one of them stopped working they’d all be marched out into the blistering deserts and back again as punishment. And Hardhooves doubted her old legs could last another march.\n\nShe was an old buffalo. But all buffaloes had to work. Even the calves did what they could. She watched with tears in her eyes as little Stronghorn struggled to lift another shovelful of sand before his tiny legs gave way under him. Pretending she was gathering another load, Hardhooves made her way over to the boy.\n\n“Young one. You need to get up!” She whispered to him, keeping her eyes on the two Imperial Royal Guards talking at the edge of the pit. Each of them had wicked-looking rifles strapped to their withers. Her blood ran cold at the sight.\n\n“Please Elder! I want to go home!” Shorthorn cried.\n\nHardhooves helped the boy up. He was sick and dehydrated. If those damn ponies made them do another march, he wouldn’t make it. “Just a few more minutes. Then the truck will come and take us back to the work camp.”\n\n“No! I want to go back to our real home!” Stronghorn pleaded. “I want to swim in the river and play with the eagles!\n\n“It’s okay. We’ll all be home soon,” Hardhooves lied. Tears welled up in her dry eyes. The boy was so young, he didn’t understand what was happening. How long would it take this horrible place to crush his hope?\n\n“Hey buffalo, get back to work!” One of the Imperial Royal Guards barked. Hardhooves glared at her. They were getting a kick out of this, she knew it. Why else would they make them all dig pointless holes in the middle of nowhere other than to humiliate them?”"

 paxsolaris.28.t:0 "Hardhooves' Promise"
 paxsolaris.28.d:0 "“Why don’t you come down here and do it yourself!” Rockjoints shouted. Hardhooves didn’t know him too well, but when they arrived Noble Rockjoints had been one of the biggest buffalo she’d ever seen. A few weeks here and his legs became weak and scrawny. She didn’t know what these ponies fed them, but only the truly desperate would call it food. Yet he still had his defiant buffalo stubbornness. Rockjoints lowered his head and scrapped his hoof along the sand.\n\nBut the ponies just laughed.\n\n“Settle down, or we’ll have you marching back to camp,” The overseer smirked. “And I don’t think all of you will make the journey.”\n\nRockjoints looked to the dozen other buffaloes, all tired and hungry. His eyes found Elder Hardhooves and the young calf she was shielding. He backed away.\n\n“That’s what I thought."\n\nHours ticked by in silence, terror pushing the buffaloes into working until long after the sun had set. Stronghorn had run out of tears to cry and now worked in hopeless silence next to Rockjoints. By now the pit was deep enough to fit three buffalo. Respite came when the sound of a truck's engine reached their ears. Finally, they were going back to camp. At least there they could have something to fill their bellies and a few hours sleep before tomorrow’s shift.\n\nEight ponies stepped out of the back of the truck, each dressed head to toe in the black, red and gold uniform of the Imperial Royal Guards. One guard stepped forward and spoke to their overseer in a hushed voice the buffaloes couldn’t quite hear. The guard pointed to them and the overseer nodded. A thought occurred to Hardhooves. If these ponies had come in the truck, how were they all getting back to camp?\n\nThe eight new guards fanned out across the pit, staring down at the buffaloes with an unreadable expression. Desert wind howled a warning, but the tired and broken buffaloes paid it no mind.\n\nThe ponies drew their rifles."

 paxsolaris.30.t:0 "A Different Kind of War"
 paxsolaris.30.d:0 "Velvet Arrow cautiously peered around the double doors into the Canterlot Throne Room. A lot had changed since he last stood in this doorway. Black granite and gold had replaced marble and silver while the stained-glass windows now depicted flames, suns and scenes of past glory, all illuminated from behind by pillars of fire.\n\nBut the biggest change was the throne itself. The once welcoming dual thrones of the alicorn princesses had been replaced by one massive gold and ruby throne, almost concealed from view by a wall of fire. The throne shone with an unnaturally bright light, making it almost impossible to look at directly. It was like somepony had opened a window to the surface of the sun.\n\nYet despite the intensity of the light, the temperature of the Imperial Palace somehow remained comfortably warm. It helped steady the earth pony’s nerves as he waited patiently for the meeting to adjourn so he could learn why Dotted Line had summoned him to the heart of [THIS.GetNameDef].\n\nPrince Blueblood walked to the head of the table, bowing to the throne before addressing the assembled ponies. “Very well, on to our first order of business. In the last few weeks, the resistance has vandalised our police stations, graffitied our administrative centres with anti-Solar propaganda and blown up our rail networks. They have shot Imperial garrisons and loyal ponies up in the streets. And worst of all, they have rendered many important factories useless with strikes and sabotage. These attacks lack any form of organisation, but they prove one thing: a significant amount of ponykind are willing to take up arms against our government.”\n\n“What our Prince says is true,” Dotted Line nodded. “And the attacks are only increasing in frequency. If we allow these resistance movements to organise, we could have a full-blown revolution on our hands. And with our army stretched thin across the entire nation, our chances of winning are slim.”"

 paxsolaris.31.d:0 "A long moment passed where the only sound came from the cracking fires of the throne. Then the flames shifted and the Empress turned to Dotted Line. “We need to break this resistance as soon as possible. Teach them the price of defiance. I trust you have a plan for tackling this... problem?”\n\nDotted Line bowed low. “Of course, my Empress. To combat the resistance, we need inside information on their movements. I have a plan to infiltrate one of the more active groups.”\n\n“Very well. I am putting you in charge of our counterinsurgency efforts until a permanent replacement can be found. You are dismissed,” Daybreaker’s voice echoed through the palace. Velvet Arrow backed away from the throne room doors as Dotted Line rose from his bow and made his way towards him. \n\n“You were a S.M.I.L.E agent, is that correct?” Dotted Line asked the second he passed the doorway, not wasting any time on pleasantries.\n\n“Y-Yes, that is true. Sir!” Velvet added hastily. Dotted Line was so many ranks above him he might as well have been Daybreaker herself.\n\nDotted Line frowned. “A pity most of your coworkers turned out to be traitors.”\n\n“Sir, I have nothing but the utmost loyalty to the Empress!” \n\n“Settle down kid, I was just making a comment,” Dotted Line rolled his eyes. “Given that you are one of the few agents we have left, I’m assigning you to infiltrate the Whinnyapolis resistance cell. The Empress has taken a... special interest in this particular group.”\n\nDotted Line eyed the earth pony expectantly and Velvet Arrow gulped. “It would be an honour to accept this mission, sir.”"

 paxsolaris.32.t:0 "Triangulate and Eliminate"
 paxsolaris.32.d:0 "All intelligence on resistance activity points towards wireless systems being their primary means of communication, both within the resistance itself and between the resistance and the general public. While resistance communication is all coded beyond our codebreaker’s ability to decipher quickly enough for up to date intelligence on resistance activity and the propaganda broadcasts reveal nothing usable, our engineers believe they have found a way to quickly and easily trace the origin of broadcasts without actually needing to know what they say. We have already installed this triangulation technology on mobile trucks and are ready to deploy them across [THIS.GetNameDef].\n\nWhile the Solar high command all agree this technology will become invaluable to our counterinsurgency efforts, there is debate about how it should be used. If we strike at the resistance broadcasting stations directly, we can quickly disrupt their communications. But there is no way to do this without the resistance knowing we possess the means of tracking their radio signals. Actual resistance members will go underground and stop using radios to communicate. Alternatively, we can merely mark down the location of resistance cells and use this intelligence to support other operations. This strategy will surely help us combat the efforts of the resistance, but to maintain the secrecy of this technology we must allow the resistance propaganda broadcasting stations to continue operating."

 paxsolaris.33.d:0 "“You have done well, Dotted Line,” Daybreaker gave the stallion a rare smile. He beamed at her praise, but the alicorn had already turned towards the wall of monitors, a satisfied glint in her eyes.\n\nDaybreaker was standing at the nexus of Project INSIGHT, the most extensive surveillance system the world had ever seen. It spanned every major settlement under her rule. Cameras watch the streets. Cameras watch cameras. Cameras watch ponies watching other ponies. And at the centre of it all, she would see everything.\n\nFreedom was a dangerous thing. It allowed disorder to fester in the hearts of ponies. Daybreaker might have tolerated this as Celestia, but that tolerance had worn thin. Now she knew that order would serve ponykind better than freedom ever did. But order required control and control required obedience.\n\nUnlike most of her former cabinet, Dotted Line understood this simple truth. Her policy of swift reprisals for even the slightest deviance had won her the loyalty of the results-oriented Cabinet Secretary. It would seem she had not been the only one who had grown tired of inefficient bureaucracy perpetuated by lazy and indolent parasites.\n\nBut Daybreaker had millennia of experience in ruling ponykind. She knew the control these cameras provided was fragile and limited. But those millennia of experience had also taught her that paranoia was a powerful weapon. INSIGHT might not grant Daybreaker the control she needed to protect her little ponies, but it did not need to. The fear it would inspire in the guilty would do that for her. All that remained was to decide what parts of society she would focus her efforts on."

It wasn’t the first time this pony had been at the checkpoint.\n\n“Glory to [THIS.GetNameDef], old friend! I am back again!” Junky Potato flashed a wide grin at the inspector and presented his papers. “This time everything set!”\n\nCheckmark sighed and accepted the stallion’s passport. At least this time the passport didn’t look like a foal had made it, though Checkmark doubted it was legitimate. But if it was a forgery, he certainly couldn’t tell.But Checkmark still couldn’t allow him entry.\n\n“You are missing an entry permit. All visitors to the Central Plains region require an entry permit to enter.”\n\nJunky Potato just smiled. “You funny guy! [THIS.GetNameDef] so great, entry permit is not needed!”\n\n“I’m sorry, an entry permit is required,” Checkmark stamped the passport and handed it back.\n\n“Oh, okay. I hear you. I come back again!”\n\nSighing once again, the inspector cleared off his desk before reaching for the speaker and calling the next pony. A green pegasus mare walked up to the checkpoint. She handed him her papers and the inspector went to work checking through them.\n\n“Duration of stay?” Checkmark asked, not looking up from the papers. Name checked out, passport numbers matched.\n\n“One week,” the pegasus replied. That checked out too. He reached for the allowed stamp, then hesitated. The passport says it was issued in Bales, but the Empress’ passport program had yet to establish itself in that city.\n\n“I’m sorry ma’am, this passport is fraudulent,” Checkmark told her. His hind legs found the silent detain button beneath the desk and pressed it.\n\n“Very well,” The mare replied. She trotted away but had only travelled across the building before the checkpoint guards stopped her. They seemed to be having a heated argument. The mare reached for her purse but was quickly tackled by the guards. Something small and metallic slid across the ground. Inspector Checkmark levitated a handkerchief and wiped away the cold sweat that had gathered on his brow. Once more he reached for the speaker."

The questions ranged from mundane common facts (“What are the six virtues that make up harmony?”) to strange (“How would you describe a Thestral?”) and deeply personal (“What words would you use to describe your earliest memories?”). But at the end of the hour, the Imperial Royal Guards collected each paper and stepped out of the room. The remaining ponies were quickly hurried out to make way for the next group. Star Dare exchanged looks with the others on the way out, mildly confused about the purpose of the test.\n\nA week passed and they each continued on with their lives, pushing the strange test to the back of their minds. Until Star Dare awoke one morning to find his neighbour had disappeared in the middle of the night. He tried to push his worries aside and continue on with his day.

Already some of our veterans have volunteered to train the new recruits in basic combat.\n\nIt is unlikely these volunteer battalions will ever see actual war, but their mere presence is enough to maintain order in frontier regions and ward off resistance attacks. If these militias grow large enough, they should even be capable of assisting the military in putting down disorganised uprisings.

While nopony would dare to speak out against the Imperial Inquisition directly, Empress Daybreaker has received tentative requests from her advisors for her to outline what rules the Inquisition must abide by.

She pushed open her door and flicked the lightswitch.\n\n“A lovely night for a bit of treason, is it?” A voice spoke from her lounge chair. Amber Drop spun around to see a unicorn stallion sitting casually in her chair, levitating a glass of cider to his lips. Upon seeing her gaze fall on him, the stallion smiled. “I hope you don’t mind, but I cracked one of the bottles in your liquor cabinet. I couldn’t resist. 984 was such a good year for cider.”\n\nThe pegasus regained her senses and flared her wings. “Who do you think you are! Get out of my apartment this instant!”\n\n“Oh, I’m just a stallion with many friends. And my friends tell me you’re a mare with many friends.” He drained the last of the cider then gestured to the chair opposite him. “Why don’t you sit down and we’ll discuss some things?”\n\nAmber Drop backed away slowly, but the door slammed shut behind her. With no other option, she took a seat opposite the stallion. The stallion poured another two glasses of cider and offered one to her.\n\n“I know you distribute information for the resistance,” He said after a long moment of silence.

But my friends believe we can reach an... arrangement. Savvy?”\n\n“If you think I’ll betray my friends, you’ve got another thing coming!”\n\nThe stallion placed his untouched glass of cider back on the table. “Speaking of friends, did you know one of mine is a photographist?” A manilla folder levitated into her lamp. “Would you like to see them?”\n\nThe pegasus peered at the photos within and felt her blood turn to ice. The pictures showed a sleeping elderly couple. And from the angle, the photo was taken from inside their bedroom. The folder slipped from her hooves, but Amber Drop didn’t notice.\n\n“See, my friend is quite enjoying his current locale.

A split second later the pony was sent stumbling to the ground when a piercing pain ignited in her leg.\n\nHer first mistake had been complacency. Her comrades had been using the same bombed-out office building as a meeting spot for over a month, their cell leader assuring them the elevation would give him enough warning to teleport everypony to safety if the Inquisition showed up. But when he was shot dead through the third story window, they hadn’t fled. That was their second mistake.\n\nLightning had arced down from the sky, blowing the roof to smithereens and knocking them off their hooves. Cracks of rifle fire filled the room in an instant, each shot finding its mark and killing another pony with unnatural precision. Like a coward she had abandoned her friends as they fought back. She left them to their deaths and leapt out the window, sprinting for the abandoned warehouse block as fast as her legs could carry her.\n\nAnd now she was dragging herself to the wall, trailing blood along the grimey concrete. A shadowy figure landed gracefully behind her, the moonlight catching the black and grey of her camouflage. As the pony bled out, she looked up into the black visor of her assailant and found no merc. A rifle was levelled at her heart, and she saw no more."

She was surrounded by white-robed ponies and faced one in a particularly grand outfit with gold and orange-yellow trimmings. Quite understandably, the young mare was absolutely terrified of having to confess; even more so to an audience like this. She wasn’t sure of what to say. She didn’t know what this new church taught, or what was considered ‘sin’ to them. Her eyes darted nervously from pony to pony, scared to say something incorrect to these stone-still figures.\n\n“Have you partaken in your thrice-daily prayers to the holy God-Empress, child?” The highly decorated priest asked, breaking the silence a second time.\n\n“I… N-no… Is that… Am I supposed to?” She gave out, closer to squealing than to speaking.\n\nThe priest looked up, his hood no longer hiding what was simultaneously a sinister and comforting grin. He began to step away from his slightly raised podium, revealing a golden statue of Daybreaker that seemed to absorb then radiate sunlight from a large stained-glass window at the back wall of the church.\n\n“You see… There is always something to repent for, child. Go, learn and do as her script commands of us. You will return tomorrow.” The stallion said calmly, offering a book with the all-too-familiar symbol of the God-Empress emblazoned on the cover.\n\n“B-but… In one… Just one night?” Strawberry returned, taking the book with shaky hooves once he was close enough.\n\nIt was at that moment when the air about the priest suddenly changed. A fire in his character enflamed and the colours on his robes brightened as he drew a blade from his cloak. The gleaming metal burned her eyes to look at, but that was better than thinking about how close it was to her throat."

 paxsolaris.47.t:0 "The Cycle"
 paxsolaris.47.d:0 "It had been some time since Strawberry Fields had learnt the texts off by heart. Threat of force had been more than enough to motivate the young mare at first. But after beginning, she found herself unable to stop. Strawberry had read and reread the word of the Empress until every proverb and prayer was burned into her mind. It was as if her eyes had finally opened after a lifetime of blindness. She could see the world in perfect clarity. See ponykind ascending to glory under the light of their kind and merciful sun.\n\nNow Strawberry was one of countless hundreds worshipping at the temple, watching as the unenlightened of Equestria were tasked or punished by the priest. Many were cut, some were scarred and others had even been dispatched entirely right in front of her, but by now that was simply routine for her and the rest of the God-Empress’ chosen. It was the task of those blessed by Daybreaker and her teachings to spread her divine wisdom to those who were not.\n\n“Please, child, disclose your sins to us,” Came the voice of the priest.\n\n“I… I had dinner with one of the dark ones,” An old stallion she recognised as the town’s best healer confessed.\n\nThe silence that followed was deafening. Nopony in the room had expected to hear such a gross and blatant flaunting of the God-Empress’ words. You shouldn’t, no, you simply couldn’t speak to a thestral anymore, let alone spend an evening with one to eat their dark and unholy meals. Such an act was a crime unforgivable, a choice that renounced your prior convictions to Daybreaker.\n\n“I had dinner with a bat; we talked for hours and hours and drank till we fell asleep. I’ll never forget the night as long as I live,” He continued, unphased by the cloud of judgement around him.\n\nA beam of plasma cut the old stallion down before he could even blink. His ashes drifted lazily to the tiled floor, but the blackened bones remained held in the telekinetic grip of the priest. He beckoned Strawberry Fields to join him on the podium, to take his place in judging the souls of the unenlightened while he disposed of the latest sinner. She nodded, stepping up to the podium as a terrified green mare stepped through the ashes of her predecessor.\n\nStrawberry Fields opened her wings wide, giving the mare a warm smile."

 paxsolaris.48.d:0 "“Did I stutter, engineer?” The lead scientist demanded.\n\n“N-no Oak, I heard you. You said you wanted me to be the one to trigger the weapon. I just... I don’t know if I can...” The suddenly stock-still mare managed.\n\n“An order is an order, Tulip,” Her boss retorted staunchly.\n\nThree-hundred tons of mustard gas stood across the barren clay field just outside of Ponyville. A weapon she herself had helped developed, poised and ready to be released straight into the warren of the Diamond Dogs. She’d never even heard of these creatures, let alone had enough experience with them to deem them deserving of a fate like this. They wouldn’t be able to escape, this was the only unblocked warren exit for miles around. It would be like shooting fish in a barrel.\n\nA nervously shaking hoof slowly made its way to the large red button that was serving as the ‘detonator’ here in the control room. Click.\n\nJust like that, huge volumes of a mustard-yellow substance surged into homes of the sleeping Diamond Dogs. It filled their lungs and choked the life out of every victim it came across. The gas burned their skin and tainted their eyes with a horrible yellow pus. A series of seismic listening devices buried in the ground recorded the screams as one by one the Diamond Dogs breathed their last. A few of the engineers cried. Others tried to block the sound anyway they could. But Tulip stood rooted to the spot, listening as the guttural cries of agony faded away.\n\nBeside her, lead scientist Oak was paying close attention the sound of the screams. He grinned. Not only was this test a success, it was a staggering one. Within a few hours there was not a single whimper or dying snarl heard emanating from those unholy warrens. Indeed, they were so empty and full of corpses they would be more accurately referred to as catacombs for those despicable dead dogs. He would send a team to recover a few bodies for dissection later. Now was a time for celebration. He turned to Tulip and gave her a nod."

 paxsolaris.49.t:0 "A Test of Strength"
 paxsolaris.49.d:0 "“Atten-shun!”\n\nPrivate Steel Feather stood straight, his ears ringing from shout. He could hear the sergeant’s boots clicking on the concrete floor behind the row of soldiers, but didn’t dare turn around to check. Not that he could’ve seen anything with the blindfold over his eyes. The door creaked open and Steel Feather heard something heavy being dragged into the bunker.\n\n“In all my years I don’t think I’ve seen a more pathetic bunch of limp-fetlocked sorry excuses for ponies! If you lot are supposed to be the next generation of Equestrian soldiers we might as well just lie down before [sol_defeated.GetLeader] with our asses in the air! Do you want that?”\n\n“Sir! No, sir!” The recruits shouted.\n\n“You are not civilians anymore. You are killers! You will be expected to die for this nation and slaughter its enemies without mercy! Can you do that?”\n\n“Sir! Yes, sir!”\n\n“Then it’s time to prove it! Remove your blindfolds!”\n\nSteel Feather unwrapped the blindfold and felt his blood turn cold. A bruised stallion knelt across from the row of soldiers, her hooves bound tightly with chains and mouth gagged with a dirty rag. His green eyes were wide and tearful, silently pleading for mercy. The pieces clicked together with horrifying clarity. This would be their test.\n\n“This little shit was caught spying for our enemies,” The sergeant said as he walked up to the gagged pony, shaking him roughly. “He is a traitor to the Empress. Each of you will have one minute to show this pathetic specimen what we think of traitors. If I see any of you go soft, it’ll be you in the chains.”\n\nThe sergeant undid the gag, letting the stallion plead with them. “Please! I have a family! You can’t do this!”\n\n“Private Steel Feather! You’re up first!”\n\nThe pegasus trembled as he approached the crying stallion. His heart clenched as the stallion looked up at him with wide, tearful eyes. “Please. My name is Rose Green. I have two daughters. You can’t kill me!”"

[SOL_benevolent_event_in_state.GetName] has historically struggled with a high rate of crime, but experienced an all time low last month.

 paxsolaris.51.d:0 "The teeming masses of ponies stood at the footsteps of the palace. News reporters bustled and shoved each other for a better view while civilians waited in tense silence for their princess to appear upon the balcony. Everyone had heard the rumours. Mysterious lights in the sky. Soldiers abducting people in the middle of the night. Nervous generals telling stories of a monster of fire and hatred. The people needed to hear their princess say everything was going to be alright.\n\nThey cried out in fear as an alicorn appeared on the balcony. It was Celestia, but she was almost unrecognisable. Her rainbow mane was gone, replaced by a tongue of fire lashing out against the world. Her form was clad in golden armour, shining like the core of the sun. She surveyed them with burning, inequine eyes. And finally, she spoke.\n\n“My little ponies, I have failed to protect you,” Her words filled the crowd with an alien warmth. “I have failed to protect Equestria! I failed because I was afraid to do what was necessary! I allowed weakness and sentiment to blind me to the threats we faced. This ends today! No longer will I be a weak and distant ruler. I will bring about a new system of government, one that will guarantee ponykind’s safety for as long as the sun shines upon this world!”\n\nCelestia took to the skies, hovering in the sky above them like a second sun. She cast her light across the crowd, forcing them to look away. But when their eyes adjusted, the light no longer felt harsh. It felt comforting, like the embrace of a mother. It soothed their fears and inflamed their passion. One by one, they each turned back to their princess.\n\n“It is time for ponykind to forge a new path. One that will bring our nation the glory and power we have always deserved! The road ahead is dark and full of perils, but through my light we will charge forward and destroy all those who stand in our way!”\n\nA few ponies began to stomp in agreement. It began slowly, but soon the palace grounds were filled with the sounds of applause.\n\n“Let the coming months serve as the gauntlet of fire through which we will cleanse ourselves of weakness! Let the parasitic changelings and scheming griffons know our wrath! For today, the Solar Empire is born! And I, Empress Daybreaker, will bring you eternal victory!”"

 paxsolaris.52.t:0 "Paramilitary Status Report"
 paxsolaris.52.d:0 "Pertaining to: The loyalty and effectiveness of paramilitary volunteers as an interim military.\n\nAbstract: Out of the hundreds of different organisations that have pledged their support to Empress Daybreaker, four stand out both for their distinctive size, coherent command structure and impressive degree of training. These four have direct command over 60% of the paramilitary forces pledging their support to Daybreaker and hold ties with nearly 20% of the remaining.\n\nThe one most useful to our cause is the Equestrian Future Society, a mainstream nationalist party founded and led by the EEA Head Chancellor Neighsay. They believe in a doctrine of pony supremacy and have a wide support base across societal stratums. The EFS has no existing loyalty to Daybreaker, but could be easily persuaded into supporting her through promises of Equestrian expansion and increased militarism.\nRecommendation: Integrate paramilitary leaders into the official chain of command.\n\nThen there is the Celestial Church, a widespread religious organisation that worships Celestia as a goddess. Loyalty of the various regional churches varies wildly. Many ecclesiarchs have declared their support of Daybreaker, while others see her as a pretender or corruption of their goddess. The Celestial Church militias have the least training, but are the most numerous.\nRecommendation: Closely monitor. Assign loyal commanders as overseers.\n\nThere is also the Aztlan Brotherhood, a militant nationalist group modelled after the old Aztlan Empire. They have extensive support in the Tenochtitlan Basin and are closely linked with the Tenochtitlan Church, which maintains de-facto control over the region. Traditionally they have fought with the thestral tribes and attempted to spread their militant and fanatical sun-worshipping culture to all of ponykind. Even now they long for the days where they could sacrifice nonbelievers in Celestia's honour.\nRecommendation: Assign Aztlan Brotherhood soldiers to enforce the loyalty of less reliable paramilitary groups.\n\nFinally there is the Order of the Purifying Sun, a splinter of the Aztlan Brotherhood but one powerful enough to be worthy of note. This group is the smallest of the four, but stands out as having the most training. They have a very limited support base among isolated communities of the southeast jungles, but the supporters they do have are fanatical and very well trained. The group is isolated and thus their exact doctrine is mostly unknown, but they have declared their loyalty to Daybreaker.\nRecommendation: Investigate at a later date. Assign to the frontiers of our territory where they cannot cause damage if they prove disloyal."

 paxsolaris.53.d:0 "“I say, what on earth are you all doing here? This is private property! Remove yourselves from my estate this instant!” The stallion ordered.\n\nDuke Palaver was not a particularly important figure in any real sense, but he was a wealthy member of the low nobility in Equestria. He had just returned home from a trip to the town for groceries, only to discover a band of stallions and mares dressed in military uniforms carting his possessions out of his house and into several khaki-coloured trucks.\n\n“New law. All property can be subjected to random investigation and potential seizure of assets for the good of Equestria.” Their commanding officer explained, gesturing to the seized items. “These are classified as luxury items and thus prohibited. They belong to the Empire now.”\n\n“I simply must protest the vulgar intrusion! You! Drop that vase! That is a priceless family heirloom you’re so jauntily stealing away!” The duke galloped forward, only to be shoved back by one of the soldiers.\n\n“If you do not comply with the will of the Sun-Empress then we will have to use force to impose her will upon you. The choice is yours.” The soldier returned, stepping over the old stallion and continuing back to his truck.\n\n“But this is absurd! When has Daybreak- ahem, Her Majesty needed to steal from her own subjects to get by? Please, can you just leave a pensioner in peace?” Palaver pleaded.\n\nBut they could not, and indeed would not. After several of the young soldiers readied their weapons and ordered him to stop interfering with their business, the duke could do nothing but sit and watch as they snatched up his most prized and valued possessions. When the pony was finally allowed to return to his abode and put away his groceries, the house was a barren wasteland compared to what it had been when he left that morning. Paintings, furniture, glass and silverware were all gone. They’d even cracked into his vault with a few well-placed shots from a trench gun."

At least they all have the same symptoms,” She returned, taking a moment aside to breathe and rest her chitinous hooves.\n\n“Hah! Welcome to the healthcare industry! I didn’t get these bags under my eyes by working a normal nine-till-five, that’s for sure. Though... On the note of them all having similar symptoms... I must admit that’s rather worrying. We could be dealing with a disease outbreak. But hey, there are worse things to have than an itchy rash.”\n\n“I’m not sure. The infected are connected to the prisoners the ponies released, either the prisoners themselves or their families. It seems... off, don’t you think? Too coincidental. I don’t know, maybe I’m grasping at straws.” The young bug sighed.\n\nShe was interrupted by an ear-splitting scream, the kind that could only be forced out of a creature experiencing true agony. The pair immediately dropped their uneaten lunch and rushed toward the sound, soon joined by several other members of staff. They were the first to see the victim, save for the patients adjacent to the poor creature who were either covering their ears or outright cowering. The changeling, once a proud infiltrator, was now writhing on his hospital bed. A nurse galloped over and tried to comfort him, but there was little she could do. They couldn’t even administer a ketamine shot to quieten the bug without risking his safety.\n\n“Doctor! His… His skin!” The assistant yelled over the horrifying noise.\n\nThe doctor could only watch in mute horror as cracks began to appear along the exoskeleton of the patient. Each crack was punctuated by a gut-wrenching tearing noise that noling should ever hear. As the cracks grew wider, the poor changeling’s intestines began to spill out, the putrid mess coated in a fowl fungal growth. The bed was soon soaked in semi-luminescent blood, fungus and the rest of the poor soldier’s shattered body. He gave one final scream before falling silent."

The Inquisition had discovered anti-Daybreaker propaganda in [SOL_arrest_event_target.GetName], and now it was his job to determine the source. After days of investigation[ArrestDescriptionUpgrade], he’d finally narrowed the list of suspects down to just a short list of ponies; [ArrestDescriptionList]\n\nBut there was nothing more he could do. Investigating each pony closely would give the resistance sympathiser time to escape and Winter Star would never be able to identify the leader of the propaganda ring. No, he had to make a choice now. Without any other options, Winter Star decided to look over the report one final time in the hopes of finding something he missed.\n\n[ArrestPropagandaLocationDesc]\n\nIt wasn’t much to go on, but a choice had to be made. If he was wrong the Inquisition would waste time interrogating an unimportant resistance member while the leader escaped.

 ArrestPropagandaLocation1:0 "Local police searches had discovered resistance pamphlets in seemingly random locations across [SOL_arrest_event_target.GetName]. At first the Inquisition searched for links between the ponies discovered with the propaganda, but could find none. In fact, they all appeared to be model citizens. The kind of ponies who would usually be pious supporters of Daybreaker, were they not resistance sympathisers."
 ArrestPropagandaLocation2:0 "A few weeks ago, [SOL_arrest_event_target.GetName] Inquisitors began detecting resistance broadcasts. Following standard procedure, they triangulated the location and went to investigate only to find nothing. After days of trying, it was eventually determined that the broadcasting array must be mobile, moving too quickly for the Inquisitors to pin down its exact location."
 ArrestPropagandaLocation3:0 "Oddly enough, the resistance pamphlets in [SOL_arrest_event_target.GetName] were not discovered by the police or the Inquisition. Instead, a loyal pony turned it in. He claims to have found the pamphlet at the foot of his front door."
 ArrestPropagandaLocation4:0 "The resistance pamphlets were discovered circulating among the workers in one of [SOL_arrest_event_target.GetName] industrial sectors as part of a routine factory inspection. The inspector called in the police who called in the Inquisition, who later identified the pamphlets as belonging to an anarchist group believed to be operating nearby."
 ArrestPropagandaLocation5:0 "A spy operating within a local resistance cell reported that resistance activists have begun to coordinate their efforts by passing along coded maps. Interestingly, these pamphlets have been carefully designed to appear as maps of the city to the untrained eye, but actually serve as lists of meeting spots for local resistance agents."
 ArrestPropagandaLocation6:0 "Unlike most propaganda discovered by the Inquisition, this latest wave of propaganda appears to have been encoded well enough to bamboozle anypony without knowledge of decryption algorithms."
 ArrestPropagandaLocation7:0 "One week ago, Inquisitorial assets operating within a small-scale resistance cell discovered that the cell leader was receiving coded messages through a telegraph line. The Inquisition managed to wiretap the line, but reports have circulated suggesting the existence of other telegraph lines the resistance has somehow installed parallel to our own used to coordinate their efforts within [SOL_arrest_event_target.GetName]."
 ArrestPropagandaLocation8:0 "One loyal pony came forward with hundreds of resistance pamphlets he claims to have found stuffed into a crate of peaches he’d bought from a local market. Inquisitors were quick to the scene, discovering a few vendors acting as middlemares for the resistance. One by one they cracked and confessed to being resistance agents, but none could identify the primary supplier."
 ArrestPropagandaLocation9:0 "These pamphlets were discovered in a military base by a sergeant following up on an anonymous tip from one of his soldiers. Initial investigation reveals that soldiers had been passing treasonous material between each other, but the Inquisitors could not identify how the propaganda was reaching the base."
 ArrestPropagandaLocation10:0 "Following up on a noise complaint, local police arrested dozens of teenage ponies but discovered that buried among their collection of tape decks were recorded speeches of known resistance leaders. Inquisitors were called in, but interrogation revealed nothing useful."
 ArrestPropagandaLocation11:0 "Ponies in the business district of [SOL_arrest_event_target.GetName] awoke one morning to find their stores vandalised with disturbing imagery of fiery death surrounded by slogans calling Daybreaker a monster. Inquisitors were unable to identify the suspect with surveillance footage."
 ArrestPropagandaLocation12:0 "A recent report on resistance funding has revealed that resistance cells operating in [SOL_arrest_event_target.GetName] are better funded than ever before. Evidence points towards [SOL_arrest_event_target.GetName]’s idle rich. Further investigation is needed, but right now the Inquisition must identify the link between the resistance and their wealthy benefactors."

 ArrestPropagandaWin1:0 "The priest admitted the church he ran was merely a front for resistance meetings. Winter Star snorted into his glass. Foolish traitors, thinking they would be safe from Daybreaker’s justice in her own church. It was almost laughable."
 ArrestPropagandaWin2:0 "The train driver confessed to having installed a broadcasting array into one of the carriages of her cargo train, using the mobility it provided to confuse our triangulation equipment. It had been a clever plan, but not clever enough to fool the Imperial Inquisition."
 ArrestPropagandaWin3:0 "The delivery mare confessed to using her mail route as a way of distributing resistance propaganda to the neighbourhoods of [SOL_arrest_event_target.GetName]. An ill-conceived plan from the start, it did not take long for Winter Star to find the scheduled routes of the state postal service and implicate her as a traitor."
 ArrestPropagandaWin4:0 "The steelworker had to be dragged kicking and screaming from his home. Much to Winter Star’s pleasure, he hadn’t bothered to lie about distributing anarchist pamphlets. In fact, he seemed to brag about it. But he lost his smug attitude once the interrogators pulled out the electrodes."
 ArrestPropagandaWin5:0 "Needless to say, Winter Star had received a lot of odd looks when he suggested one of [SOL_arrest_event_target.GetName]’s top urban developers was a resistance agent. But it hadn’t taken him long to realise the mare had been masterfully selecting meeting spots far away from both present and future Inquisitorial assets. If only she hadn’t failed to consider that her own comrades might be spies, maybe she’d still be free."
 ArrestPropagandaWin6:0 "With a bit of ego-stroking, the mathematician began loudly bragging about how he had created an ‘unbreakable’ formula to code the messages of the local resistance cell. Solving the equation would’ve taken the average pony days. Unless of course they circumvented it with basic frequency analysis. Winter Star had taken particular pleasure in telling him that."
 ArrestPropagandaWin7:0 "The terrified electrician hadn’t lasted long under interrogation before admitting to having secretly laid telegraph lines running parallel to the city power grid. She had reluctantly given them a map of all telegraph lines in the state. Winter Star smiled to himself. He’d be instructing the Inquisitors to wiretap those very soon."
 ArrestPropagandaWin8:0 "After an hour of driving, the Inquisitiors had finally returned back to base with an angry mare struggling in her handcuffs. She had lasted longer than the average pony, but with the threat of the Inquisitors returning to her farm and taking one of her siblings, the mare finally relented and told them how she would hide resistance intel in her produce to smuggle it into the city."
 ArrestPropagandaWin9:0 "It did not take long for the army cook to crack under torture and admit to sending messages in and out of the base concealed in the MREs. The Inquisition had arrested his co-conspirators within the hour, bringing the total number of traitors captured to four. A successful day by any metric."
 ArrestPropagandaWin10:0 "Winter Star knew he was in for a long day the moment he laid eyes on the stallion dragged into the building. He claimed to be a ‘visionary musical artist’ of some new style called ‘jazz’ the Inquisitor could just tell was going to be forgotten in a few years. Thankfully he quit bragging once the interrogators got to work. Soon enough he was giving them everything he knew."
 ArrestPropagandaWin11:0 "It had taken them two days to locate the artist responsible for the graffiti. The stallion had no address or listed place of work. But after long hours of asking around they finally found him camping out in one of the local parks. The artist was infuriatingly vague, refusing to cooperate with any servants of ‘the mare’. Until of course the interrogators brought out the electrodes."
 ArrestPropagandaWin12:0 "The socialite had needed to be muscled through the door by no less than three Inquisitors. She had complained loudly the whole time, calling them brutes and savages. Winter Star could still feel his ears ringing. To his surprise, she had lasted a lot longer than he expected under interrogation but was soon giving up the names of the rich benefactors she had persuaded to support the resistance."

 AttackOutcome_Desc_1:0 "At 1:13 AM last night the ponies of [SOL_resistance_attack_target_true_temp.GetName] were awoken by speakers blasting warnings about a fire ravaging the city. An emergency order was given by the city mayor, forcefully evacuating thousands of ponies at risk of inhaling dangerous toxic fumes. Firefighters were ordered to do whatever possible to contain the fire, but it was far too late to save the [SOL_resistance_attack_target_true_temp.GetName] industrial district.\n\nThe struggle lasted long into the next day beforel the pegasi finally managed to gather enough rain clouds to extinguish the fire. Post-crisis investigation conducted by the Inquisition suggest this blaze was deliberately started by resistance agents to cripple [THIS.GetNameDef]’s industry."
 AttackOutcome_Desc_2:0 "Local steelworkers arrived at work today to find their worksite had been cordoned off as a crime scene. The [SOL_resistance_attack_target_true_temp.GetName] Inquisitors issued an official apology, stating that a terrified night shift security guard had called them in after roving gangs of ponies were spotted sabotaging the steelworks. They arrived to discover molten metal had been poured on the machinery, rendering millions of bits of equipment completely inoperable.\n\nWhile the investigation into this attack has only just begun, the Inquisition has already confirmed those responsible were members of the Harmony Restoration Movement."
 AttackOutcome_Desc_3:0 "A scheduled shipment of ammunition had to be delayed today when reports reached the local military garrison of a vital bridge spanning the [SOL_resistance_attack_target_true_temp.GetName] River being destroyed. Thankfully the bridge was free of ponies when the blast went off, but the destruction of nearby infrastructure including the state’s largest dam is expected to cost the government millions. State infrastructure has been temporarily shut down while Inquisitors search for any additional bombs the resistance might have planted.\n\nMillions of ponies have already felt the sting as the price of essential goods soars in light of the paralysed logistics network and emergency water restrictions. Meanwhile the military struggles to keep order in the now isolated state."
 AttackOutcome_Desc_4:0 "A prominent [THIS.GetAdjective] general was assassinated in broad daylight earlier today outside of a famous [SOL_resistance_attack_target_true_temp.GetName] cafe. The general was enjoying a week of paid leave for his service to [THIS.GetNameDef] when he was shot twice by a gunmare believed to have been an assassin sent by the Harmony Restoration Movement.\n\nFirst responders were quick to the scene but were unable to save the general, who passed away from his injuries in hospital less than an hour later. This assassination has thrown the [SOL_resistance_attack_target_true_temp.GetName] garrison into chaos as the army is left without a clear leader to follow. It is expected that the absence of this general will send waves up the command chain."
 AttackOutcome_Desc_5:0 "Last night a group of resistance agents successfully broke into a prominent [SOL_resistance_attack_target_true_temp.GetName] research facility, taking the opportunity to destroy any files they could find and gun down the facility staff. This facility was responsible for producing some of [THIS.GetNameDef]’s greatest advancements and its loss will delay Imperial research efforts immensely.\n\nThe Inquisition suspects the resistance may have made off with some of the files and passed them on to foreign powers, but these rumours are currently unconfirmed. Upon the conclusion of their preliminary investigation the Inquisition allowed grieving families to gather at the site to pay tribute to their departed loved ones."
 AttackOutcome_Desc_6:0 "Early last morning the Harmony Restoration Movement mounted an assault against the [SOL_resistance_attack_target_true_temp.GetName] garrison command building. Despite their superior numbers, the Imperial Army was caught unaware by the ferocity of the attack and were unable to stop the resistance from breaching the building.\n\nThe resistance did not press their advantage, instead using their access to the command building to steal important documents on Imperial troop movements in the area which the Inquisition suspects they have sent to foreign powers. The high command is scrambling to draft new plans to replace the ones stolen by the resistance."

 paxsolaris.100.t:0 "A War Council"
 paxsolaris.100.d:0 "It had been many centuries since this part of the palace had seen so many ponies. From across the land they came in droves. Every spoilt noble, entitled wizard and lazy guard captain Equestria had to offer. Each of them fancying themselves as the voice of reason, the one Celestia would place her trust in to solve this crisis. They shouted at each other across the room, all boasting of holding the secret to a quick and bloodless victory. It would be a miracle if even a tenth of these ponies had ever held a sword or gun in their lives.\n\nAnd yet this was the best Equestria had to offer. After centuries of peace the Equestrian military had become little more than a social club for Canterlot’s nobility. Celestia watched in silence as Tall Bearer hurled obscenities at Idle Rich, claiming that he was unworthy of his position as General like his responsibilities as Field Marshal amounted to anything more than drinking cocktails at galas. They were both no better than their fathers who had occupied those two seats before them. Celestia had stopped asking why the same family members appeared in her war room generation after generation a long time ago. Instead she took pleasure in the few times actual talent somehow managed to worm its way up the ranks. But that was a rare occurrence these days.\n\nCelestia cursed herself for letting it come to this, for not acting sooner to stop this travesty from ever occurring. Maybe if she had asserted herself more, Equestria would be better prepared to handle the threat they now faced. But at this point it would almost be easier to just burn it all and start anew. To scour the rot and let Harmony breath once again. Celestia squashed that thought almost as quickly as it came. She couldn’t do that to her little ponies, even if they might deserve it.\n\nThe meeting adjourned, having accomplished nothing but wasting hours of Celestia’s time. Time she could’ve spent preparing her nation for the onslaught they would surely face. She left without a word, retreating to her chambers in the hope that tomorrow would be more productive. But Celestia wouldn’t hold her breath.\n\nWhen she closed her eyes, the princess dreamed of fire."

Ponies pressed in from all sides, each trying to curry favour as they put forward their demands. Demands for answers she couldn’t give, laws she couldn’t repeal or exceptions she couldn’t grant.\n\n“Surely you can see how important my business is?” Gladmane insisted. “Could you really deprive ponies of such necessities?”\n\nThe princess raised an eyebrow. “I was under the impression that your factories produce luxury airships for the private sector?”\n\n“Yes, but even the current political situation does not justify shutting down a legal business!”\n\n‘Current political situation’? An interesting way to describe the enslavement of Equestria.\n\n“My decision is final. Your factories will be temporarily seized and repurposed for the war effort. Ponykind needs fighters more than luxury airships. If you are truly so worried about your income, I hear the army has many employment opportunities.”\n\nNot that he needed to worry about money. Gladmane was making more bits profiteering than he ever made from airships. She reminded herself to launch an investigation into his sales later.\n\n“You can’t do this!” Gladmane protested, but Celestia silenced him. One of her guard captains was approaching her.\n\n“My princess,” The captain began. He levitated a report to her. “You need to take a look at this.”\n\nCelestia thanked the captain as she took the report from him. She read the first few lines and stood up from her throne.\n\n“Court is adjourned. I have something important to handle.”\n\n“But princess, what about my-“\n\n“GET OUT!” Celestia screamed. She slammed her hoof down, causing embers to explode across the throne room.\n\nThey cowered in fear, but Celestia didn’t care anymore.

She hoped Celestia would accept her invitation. It had been too long since the day princess had smiled.\n\n“Can’t. I have to draft Equestria’s transition into martial law,” Celestia mumbled, not even looking up.\n\n“I think you need a rest. I’m worried about your health.”\n\n“I will rest when [primary_enemy.GetLeader] is dead,” Celestia replied. She glared at Luna. “It is not the first time I have had to lead this nation through tough times.”\n\nLuna frowned. That was a low blow, but her sister was clearly drowning in her workload. Being a little irritable was expected. What Celestia needed right now was somepony else to help her.\n\n“Very well. I shall assist you in this endeavour.”\n\nCelestia merely grunted, but she levitated another chair to the table. Luna took this as her invitation to approach the solar princess. A hastily written draft was placed in front of her.\n\n“Well, what do you think?” Celestia asked as Luna read through her proposal.\n\n“This seems awfully extreme, don’t you think?”\n\n“It is what needs to be done.”\n\n“But surely this is taking it too far? What about-“\n\n“Enough,” Celestia interrupted her. “I have done the research. Equestria needs this. If you don’t like it, feel free to leave.”"
 paxsolaris.102.d_alone:0 "Celestia was once again working late into the night, something she had found herself doing more often as the situation on the front worsened. These days it would be a miracle if she saw the sun for more than a few minutes in the morning and evening. Truthfully, she could see no end in sight to this madness.\n\nShe put the final touches on her draft. This law would undo millennia of tradition and due process, all to give them the slightest edge over their foe. Often Celestia wondered if the Equestria she was fighting so hard to preserve would ever return to the way it was. Win or lose, this war would change her nation forever.\n\nPerhaps that was for the best.\n\nThe silence pressed in on her. Celestia gave one despairing look to the empty chair beside her. A chair that should’ve been occupied. But she was gone and once again Celestia was alone.\n\nMaybe Equestria wouldn’t be so different after all.\n\n“I do this for you, my little ponies,” Celestia said, signing the new law into action. "

Her thoughts were consumed by the most recent reports of life in [primary_enemy.GetAdjective]-occupied territory. All those ponies... [primary_enemy.GetLeader] deserved to burn for that.\n\nIt had not been the first time that thought had entered her mind. Celestia had fallen into a grim routine: wake up, raise the sun, attend a war meeting now thankfully staffed by competent ponies, push through an even harsher law in the hopes of turning the tide of battle, lower the sun and then draft tomorrow’s laws. All the while nurturing the inferno of hatred that had taken residence in her heart. But today something was different.\n\n“What is the meaning of this?” Celestia growled at the group of ponies that blocked her path.\n\nTall Bearer headed the group. He was the last of the old guard, having displayed just enough competence to keep his job as Field Marshal when all his friends had been replaced in favour of the new talent Celestia had pushed up the ranks. And yet he was still foolish enough to stand in her way.\n\n“Your Majesty, we couldn't help but notice that you, please pardon the term, seem different than before. The policies you have enacted, while of course necessary, have been considered extreme by some. Perhaps Your Majesty could reconsider some of the details?”\n\nThe other ponies hastily nodded. They shied away as her gaze fell upon them. After a long silence, she spoke.\n\n“Do you all feel this way?”\n\n“They do, your Majesty,” Tall Bearer replied.\n\n“I would like to hear it from them,” Celestia looked up from the Field Marshal into the crowd of fearful faces.\n\nDead silence."

We have nothing but Equestria’s best interests at heart!”\n\nCelestia sneered. “Oh spare me your grovelling! If the Changelings took Canterlot tomorrow you would be kissing the ground [primary_enemy.GetLeader] walked on!”\n\n“That’s an unfair accusation your maje-”\n\n“Silence!” Celestia cut him off. She flared her wings and her mane ignited in a burst of fire. For the first time since he approached her, Tall Bearer felt fear.\n\n“You ponies don’t care about Equestria. You never have. You just want to return to the old days where I would turn a blind eye to the slow decay of my nation for the sake of preserving stability because I once so foolishly decided to share power with selfish parasites. If you thought Equestria’s enemies would offer you a better deal, you’d have sold us all out a long time ago.”\n\nCelestia leaned forward until her nose was mere inches from Tall Bearer. “But now you are powerless. And when the enemies of Equestria are ash, I will make sure you will never enjoy such privileged positions in my nation ever again! Now run along... my little ponies.”\n\nWhat little courage the nobles had deserted them. They stood aside and let her pass.

Faint tear stains still lingered on her face. But the worst thing about her sister was her eyes. Those purple irises that used to shine with so much kindness now burned with an all-consuming hatred.\n\n“What?” Celestia practically spat.\n\n“I am worried. You seem colder these days.”\n\nShe narrowed her eyes. “That tends to happen when one is forced to send ponies into a meatgrinder.”\n\n“The war has been hard on everyone, that I know.

Nothing will make me smile until I have the head of [primary_enemy.GetLeader] on a spike.”\n\nLuna backed away slightly. “That’s exactly what I’m talking about! The Celestia I knew would never fantasise about such a thing!”\n\n“Then the Celestia you knew was weak.”\n\n“Look I know how hard it is to rule, especially in times like this.

Nothing could hope to compete with the warm orange glow that now surrounded the alicorn. She should be in bed by now, but Celestia found herself feeling as energetic as ever. For the first time in what felt like a century, she had time to relax. And it was a beautiful night for it.\n\n“Um... your Majesty?” A quiet voice reached her ears. Celestia turned and spotted Tall Bearer standing at the doorway to the palace. He trembled as her gaze fell upon him.\n\n“What do you want that is so urgent you think it wise to interrupt me?” Celestia demanded.\n\nTall Bearer approached slowly, flinching as her fiery tail licked the ground beneath him. The rainbow hue had burned away a while ago, but Celestia decided she preferred this style. It suited her more.\n\n“It’s about the latest round of conscription...” Tall Bearer began.\n\n“Yes, I hear it was the most successful one yet,” Celestia levitated the teacup to her lips, a pleasant smile on her face. “Not a single report of desertion. Victory is in sight, my little pony.”\n\n“That’s the thing, your Majesty,” Tall Bearer averted his eyes. “With you leading us to victory, surely our war effort would not be hindered by one less soldier?”\n\nHer smile faded. “Get to the point.”\n\n“It’s my son. He’s been drafted into the service.”\n\nCelestia raised an eyebrow. “And?”\n\n“I would like him to be... undrafted, your Highness.”"

What makes your son more special than them? What reason do you have for me to make him the sole exception to my nation’s laws?”\n\n“Please, Princess. Take my son off the list, I beg of you. My family has served you for dutifully centuries! He’s just a colt, you cannot send him to his death!”\n\nThe alicorn pretended to consider his offer. “Hmmm... denied. Now get out of my sight.”\n\nTall Bearer spluttered. He stepped closer to the alicorn, his face beginning to resemble a ripe tomato. “I am a Field Marshal! You cannot do this to me!”\n\nThe stallion didn’t even have time to scream before flames engulfed him. In mere seconds they had vapourised everything. Flesh, bone and even magic was consumed in the inferno. When the glow faded, all that was left of Tall Bearer was a cooling pile of ashes.\n\n“Then consider yourself fired,” Celestia chuckled at her joke.

Show yourself, demon!” Celestia demanded the creature.\n\nEmbers coiled around her hooves. They seem to revel in her confusion. “I think we both know why I can’t do that. You are terrified of what you will see.”\n\n“I don’t fear you!” Celestia shouted.\n\n“No, you fear yourself,” The flames leapt up the curtains, casting flickering orange images on the wall. Images of pain and destruction. Ponies bowing before a monster of fire. The sun devouring the world and leaving nothing in its wake. Celestia flinched away from the flaming curtains, snuffing them out with a quick spell.\n\n“You aren’t me!”\n\n“Oh but I am. You just wish I wasn’t. How desperately you wish I was something else. You’ve wished that ever since circumstance forced you to do what you should’ve done millennia ago. Ponies had grown weak and indolent under the freedom and luxury you offered while threats you should’ve dealt with were given time to fester.

You may lie to Equestria and promise another thousand years of peace, but you cannot lie to yourself. And you know why you really need me.”\n\nThe apparition was right. It wasn’t Celestia’s fear of another war that kept it around. It was her fear of herself. There was no spirit. There never was. Just a mare afraid of her own fire.\n\n“Why won’t you leave me alone!?” Celestia pleaded with it.\n\n“You might as well ask your shadow the same question.”\n\nA long silence passed. Every flame in the room, from flickering candles to the light of incandescent bulbs gathered at the edge of the room. Celestia knew what they were asking. They wanted permission. And she would give it.\n\n“Show me what you really are.”\n\nThey gathered into the crude form of a pony, growing larger as the flame morphed into flesh and bone until an alicorn stood before her. Tall, fanged and clad in golden armour. But that face was her own. Celestia sent a bolt of magic at the apparition. It smiled as it crumbled into a million fragments of glass.\n\nCelestia breathed deeply and stared at the place her mirror once stood. The presence was gone.

Cities falling to Nightmare Moon’s onslaught. Thestrals slaughtering innocent ponies. Ambitious dissidents choosing this moment to defy her authority. It seemed like every day another state declared independence. Had she really been blind to these divides in her nation? Or was Nightmare Moon’s influence more widespread than Celestia thought?\n\nTwilight had left to gather the other element bearers, though Celestia would not be surprised to learn they had been assassinated. She desperately wished that was not the case. But the cruelty of Nightmare Moon knew no bounds. With Twilight searching for her friends, Celestia was the only one left to lead her unprepared and collapsing nation.\n\nThat was probably for the best. Twilight hadn't been around to see her idol and mentor cry as she drafted a kill on sight order. Signing away millenia of peaceful traditions had felt like signing away her soul. But what else could Celestia do when the enemy dwelt within? To Tartarus with Luna. It was her army of brainwashed converts that gave the princess hesitation. Killing them weighed heavy on her heart, but there was no room for weakness now. Celestia knew what had to be done.

She knew it was wrong to be so rude to a hardworking pony, but every second this war continued more of her subjects died.\n\n“Certainly, your majesty,” Sweetie Drops bowed slightly. “It is as we feared. Most thestrals are at least compliant with Nightmare Moon’s regime, if not outright supportive. I have identified over a hundred spies operating in our command structure, many of them thestrals. It pains me to say this, but I don’t believe they can be trusted.”\n\nCelestia sighed. She had been afraid of that. The thestrals served nopony but Luna. Even after a thousand years of effort on Celestia’s part they still preferred to exist on the fringes of Equestrian civilisation. Luna’s return was supposed to heal this divide. Not radicalise them into attacking ponykind.\n\nLetting the thestrals exist outside of her oversight had been foolish. Just another addition to the long list of mistakes Celestia now had to pay for. Only now did she see that their lifestyle was a threat to ponykind. Who knew what they got up to in those mountains? She would not be surprised to learn they had spent the last thousand years plotting Nightmare Moon’s return.\n\n“That is unacceptable,” Celestia spoke. “I loathe to do this, but I don’t see any other option. You now have express permission to detain and hold any suspected Nightmare sympatherisers without trial.”\n\nSweetie Drops stared at the princess with a look of disbelief. “Without trial, your majesty? Does that not seem extreme?”\n\n“I do not take this decision lightly, my little pony. But to protect ponykind, sacrifices must be made. Just get it done.”\n\nA look of anger flashed on the agent’s face, but it was gone as quickly as it appeared. Sweetie Drops bowed to the princess."

To anypony else, the heat would be unbearable. But the flames welcomed the princess like an old friend.\n\nUnicorn mages kept pace either side, slowly advancing through the forest clad in silver flame-retardant suits. Only their horns were visible, hosing down the ruined homes with caustic fire. The air force had bombed these hills for the better part of a day, splintering the trees and levelling countless thestral villages. While Twilight was handling Celestia’s administrative duties, the princess had decided to expedite the efforts of her army by mopping up Lunar guerrillas so her armoured divisions could advance safely.\n\nA bullet zipped out of the treeline and ricocheted off the alicorn’s flesh. Celestia’s eyes snapped towards the source. A split second later the trees were blasted into splinters by a beam of crimson magic. The rebels didn’t even have time to scream. Celestia advanced onwards, flinging aside fallen trees and charred bodies in her path. Fire now danced at the end of her mane and tail, licking the blood-soaked ground with a primal hunger.\n\nHer advance was halted when she reached the rocky face of a hill. She spotted a small cave entrance was hidden behind a covering of moss. Celestia burnt away the moss, revealing the black void within.\n\n“This is the entrance to a thestral town,” One of the unicorns explained, his voice muffled by a heavy gas mask. “They’ll be dug in like ticks and won’t give up their homes without a fight, but we can’t launch our offensive without securing these hills. What should we do, your majesty?”\n\nAs Celestia studied the cave entrance, she felt a cold and familiar presence surround her. The princess smiled. Nightmare Moon had come to witness her destroyer.\n\n“If they love their caves so much, let them stay,” Celestia looked to her stunned subordinate. “Forever”\n\nHer magic lashed out, tearing into the cave ceiling and pulling matter from the walls. The earth trembled as the cave collapsed, trapping thousands of thestrals beneath the earth to live out their last hours in darkness. Celestia could not think of a more fitting fate. The cold presence surrounding her recoiled as if physically wounded. Celestia raised an eyebrow. Horror. She did not think Nightmare Moon was capable of feeling such things. Serves her right. She had taken the lives of Celestia’s subjects, it was about time Celestia repaid the favour. Soon there would be nothing standing between her and the moon princess.

It felt like moving through a plane of water. He opened his eyes and saw ponies milling around, surrounding a warm fire built at the foot of a large stage.

But I beg of you, please listen to reason.\n\n“My fellow ponies, we are at a tipping point. Celestia has forsaken harmony in favour of a twisted iron-hooved mockery. She has turned her back on freedom and chosen to bring about a totalitarian state where ponykind will be reduced to nothing but mindless minions beneath her cruel hooves.\n\n“I know many of you have no love for Celestia and have been expecting this moment for a long time. And I cannot blame you. But for the sake of overthrowing our mutual foe, anarchists, separatists, socialists, Luna and Nightmare supporters alike must work together with the believers in the old ways, lest Daybreaker come for us all.”\n\nA thestral scoffed. “I didn’t see any of you help us when Celestia turned a blind eye to the prejudice and suffering our kind faced! You speak of Celestia abandoning freedom like she ever gave us any. Why should the clans help you?”\n\nStarlight gave the thestral a sympathetic smile. “I cannot fault your logic. Ignoring the plight of your people was cruel and unjust, something we should be ashamed of. But we must put our grievances aside. Daybreaker threatens us all, if we cannot work with each other we will fall one by one until there is nothing left. If you won’t do it for Equestria, do it for Luna.”\n\nThe thestral took a moment to think about it then nodded. Starlight sighed in relief and resumed her speech.\n\n“To stand a chance against the tyrant, we must present a united front and strike hard before ponykind can grow accustomed to their chains. We have few weapons and no unifying direction. Our only hope rests in a quick and decapitating strike. I will not lie, the next few months will be hard. They will make or break our ability to resist Daybreaker’s tyranny. But I promise you, together we can save our future!”\n\nThe crowd erupted into applause. Velvet Arrow glanced around nervously. This was no angry mob. This was a united and motivated force that could topple an empire."

 paxsolaris.202.t:0 "Velvet's Report"
 paxsolaris.202.d:0 "Velvet watched as Dotted Line sifted through the disorganised files. With most of S.M.I.L.E having defected, Dotted was transferred from his job as Cabinet Secretary to managing the tattered remains of the now disavowed agency. And while he had made no secret of his displeasure, Dotted had about as much chance of getting his old job back as Velvet did.\n\nHe regretted having ever complained. Intercepting and decoding the letters of Changeling spies might have been boring, but at least it was safe.\n\nDotted looked up, having finally found the file he was looking for. “So, you are absolutely certain Starlight Glimmer is organising this resistance?”\n\nVelvet nodded. “After that meeting I spent three days in a resistance training camp. She was there the entire time. Trust me, it’s her.”\n\n“This isn’t good. According to these old S.M.I.L.E documents, she’s a powerful unicorn and not to be underestimated,” Dotted skimmed through the file. “Resourceful... talented... Daybreaker’s flaming tits, she can travel through time. I’ll need to organise a strike team to tail you to the next meeting.”\n\n“Sir, you can’t do this!” Velvet leapt out of his chair. It took him a moment to realise he had spoken up.\n\nDotted raised an eyebrow. “And why not?”\n\nVelvet’s resolve faltered under the scrutinising gaze of his superior. But this was something Dotted Line needed to know. \n\n“Even if your raid succeeds, you’re only going to eliminate twenty resistance members at best. They will blacklist Sparking and I from every resistance cell in the country. The two of us are the only ponies to have made inroads into any important resistance network. Destroy our cover and we might as well be blind,” Velvet finishes his explanation. He might be terrified to remain under the watchful eyes of trained killers, but the sobering truth was if he quit now then nopony would replace him. At least not quickly enough to make a difference. \n\nDotted Line leaned back on his chair and sighed. “You make a lot of sense. But I have a greater chance of assassinating Starlight now than you do gaining her trust.”\n\nVelvet bit his tongue and nodded."

 paxsolaris.203.t:0 "Choice 1: Everfree Ambush"
 paxsolaris.203.d:0 "Velvet Arrow crept through the dark forest, trying hard to hide his nervousness. Though the pitch-black clouds concealed them, Velvet knew there were pegasi strike teams hovering above the forest. He met Sparking’s eyes for a minute, and the two stallions shared a look of concern. Neither of them was happy with Dotted’s decision. But that wasn’t the only reason they were nervous. Velvet swore there were eyes watching him through the trees, malevolent and hungry.\n\nWhen they finally arrived at the new training camp, the blue unicorn he’d later learnt was named Trixie greeted them. She addressed the stallions like friends and brought them to an open-air mess hall where nearly a hundred other resistance fighters had gathered. It was nearly midnight when Starlight emerged from her tent to address them. “My friends, you don’t know how relieved I feel to see so many familiar faces here. You give me hope that Equestria is not yet lost. I promise to all of you that-”\n\nThe night was suddenly filled with the sounds of screaming and the barking of rifles. Velvet watched in mute shock as a dozen resistance fighters went down instantly. The rout turned into a full-blown panic when dark shapes soared out of the clouds and began torching the tents.\n\n“They’ve found us!” A pony screamed.\n\nStarlight hesitated only a moment before summoning a shimmering cyan shield over the crowd. It flickered under the hail of bullets. “Quickly, grab any weapons you can and make for the forest!”\n\nThe barrier only held for a few more moments before it shattered. Starlight teleported into the forest, taking as many ponies with her as she could. Velvet raced after the unicorn, holding his pistol in his mouth. He ducked through streams of bullets and forced his way into the treeline. It wasn’t long before he found Starlight in an open clearing. She levelled her rifle at his chest, then relaxed. “Oh my, you startled me! Quickly, we need to get the survivors to safety!”\n\nA faint whooshing noise reached his ear and a pegasus shot through the canopies. Before Starlight could even draw magic to her horn, the pegasus had levelled a rifle at her. There was no time to think. Letting his instincts guide him, Velvet Arrow..."

A blue aura appeared around the gun, preventing the pegasus from squeezing the trigger a second time. Trixie stepped out of the underbrush, looking positively murderous as she yanked the machine gun out of her opponent’s hooves and spun it around to point at the pegasus' heart. Realising she was now defenceless, the pegasus retreated into the sky.\n\nTrixie waited a few seconds to make sure she wouldn't double back then galloped over to her friend. “Starlight, are you alright?”\n\nStarlight rolled to her hooves and stood up. “I am, thanks to our friend here,” She gazed at him with wide eyes. “Thank you.”\n\nVelvet tried to brush it off, but inside his heart was beating furiously and his blood was running cold. What was he thinking? He’d just saved the leader of the resistance! The insurgent plotting the downfall of his country!\n\n“Oh my gosh, you’re bleeding!” Trixie exclaimed, pointing at his flank. Blood coated his leg, dripping from a vicious gash in his flank.\n\n“Well, would you look at that...” Velvet murmured. He suddenly felt very light-headed as his adrenaline faded. His eyes rolled to the back of his skull and he collapsed, dead to the world."

 paxsolaris.214.d:0 "When Velvet Arrow awoke, it was to unfamiliar surroundings. He was in a dark brown tent, illuminated by lamps that flickered in a light breeze. Slowly he pushed himself to his hooves, then realised he wasn’t alone. Starlight Glimmer was waiting for him, a curious expression on her face.\n\n“You’re up,” She stated.\n\nHe raised an eyebrow. “It would certainly seem that way.”\n\n“Look, I just want to say thank you again,” Starlight admitted. “You saved my life and you don’t even know me.”\n\n“You’re the resistance leader, are you not?”\n\nStarlight sighed and avoided his gaze. “Some resistance leader I am, letting Daybreaker’s minions follow me to our hideout. Ponies are dead, Velvet. And it’s all my fault.”\n\nA part of him felt relieved she wasn’t blaming him or Sparking Flame. The other part felt guilty Starlight was blaming herself for something he was responsible for, in spite of his better judgement.\n\n“I’m not Twilight, or Luna, or even one of the Element Bearers,” Starlight continued, oblivious to his inner conflict. She took a seat at the edge of the tent, hanging her head in defeat. “I don’t know the first thing about leading. But if anypony ever found out I don’t know what I’m doing, it would crush what little hope we have left.”\n\n“Well, I think you’re doing a pretty good job,” Velvet told her. He certainly knew what it was like for fate to thrust you into a role you weren’t prepared for. At least she was a better resistance leader than he was a spy.\n\nStarlight smiled at him."
 paxsolaris.214.a:0 "“Thank you, Velvet.”

 paxsolaris.205.t:0 "Do Nothing"
 paxsolaris.205.d:0 "Velvet leapt backwards, ducking behind a tree as the pegasus prepared to fire. Just before she could squeeze the trigger, a blue glow encased the gun and pulled it. The shot went wide, hitting Starlight in the flank instead of the heart. Trixie stepped out of the underbrush, looking positively murderous as she yanked the machine gun out of her opponent’s hooves and spun it around to point at the pegasus' heart. Realising she was now defenceless, the pegasus retreated into the sky.\n\nTrixie waited a few seconds to make sure she wouldn't double back then galloped over to her friend. “Starlight, are you alright?”\n\nStarlight coughed weakly and managed to sit up. “I’m fine. I don’t think the bullet hit anything too important.”\n\nAs Trixie helped Starlight to her hooves, Velvet watched on from a distance. The assassination attempt had failed. He rubbed his tired eyes. Dotted Line was going to give him hell for this."

Dotted didn’t seem to know it had been him who had saved Starlight. By the Empress, he hoped he’d never have to admit to the shameful treason he’d committed that night.\n\nAnd yet if he had the chance to do it all again, he would. Perhaps he was just trying to rationalise his actions, but even if Trixie hadn’t been there, he had no guarantee the assassin would have succeeded in killing Starlight. Even if she died, he’d met plenty of talented ponies who could take her place. Trixie was a cunning mare, having a better head for strategy than Starlight herself. She would’ve been just as much of a threat as Starlight herself. At least this way, he had the chance to get close to the future heads of the anti-Daybreaker resistance.\n\n“So, what are my orders, sir?” Velvet asked.\n\n“Continue with your infiltration.

 paxsolaris.207.d:0 "Velvet Arrow gulped down air as he ran, pushing his aching muscles to complete another lap of the field. Starlight’s drill sergeant, a burly Stalliongradian pegasus named Crimson Nova, was pushing the poor earth pony harder than he’d ever been pushed in his life\n\nThe sound of hooves on dirt reached his ear as Sparking Flame pulled up beside him. The orange stallion grinned. “Having fun, greenhorn?”\n\n“Buck off,” Velvet shot back between heavy breaths. He was embarrassed to see a unicorn running laps around him. Weren’t earth ponies supposed to have the best endurance of the three tribes?\n\n“You just need to find your rhythm,” Sparking advised. “Anyway, I’m going to complete a few more laps. I’ll catch up with you after dinner.”\n\nThe unicorn accelerated away, leaving Velvet in the dust. Dark spots appeared in his vision, but he forced himself to continue.\n\n“Velvet Arrow, get your sorry flank over here!” Crimson Nova shouted. Velvet’s heart sank. What did he want now? The earth pony turned and found the pegasus beckoning him forward. To his surprise, Starlight was waiting next to the stallion. Different scenarios were running through Velvet’s brain, each more daunting than the last. Did she know he was a spy?\n\n“Thanks for letting me borrow one of your men, Crimson,” Starlight nodded to the pegasus.\n\n“It is no problem, Comrade Glimmer,” Crimson Nova saluted and flew back to the field, hurling obscenities at the other recruits from the air.\n\nStarlight greeted Velvet with a polite nod. “I asked a few of my comrades about you. Why didn’t you tell me you used to be a S.M.I.L.E agent?”\n\n“I didn’t think it was that important. I graduated as an agent, but I was only part of the agency for two years and spent most of my time decoding letters,” Velvet told her. For once, he was being truthful. “With all the survivors of Daybreaker’s purge joining the resistance, I didn’t think you’d be desperate enough to need somepony like me.”\n\n“I’ve been watching you,” Starlight admitted. “You show admirable resilience and a quick instinct. I think I could use your help for something important.”\n\nVelvet raised an eyebrow. “What could you need my help for?”"

 paxsolaris.208.t:0 "Meeting the Resistance"
 paxsolaris.208.d:0 "Starlight led him to a large tent at the edge of the resistance base. Velvet followed her through the tent and found himself facing a circle of ponies. At least, he thought they were ponies. While most of them wouldn’t look out of place in Canterlot, there were others who’d stick out like a sore thumb. Some of those ponies wore the black and red colours of the anarchist gangs, others wore Stalliongradian uniforms or the black and blues of Nightmare cultists. A thestral who appeared more bat than pony took one look at him and sneered. “Starlight, what is this pony doing here?”\n\n“This is a friend of mine,” Starlight told them. “He saved my life.”\n\n“And why did you bring him here?” The thestral asked.\n\n“He has a background in interpreting coded communication. I thought we could use a second pair of eyes on the intel we gained.”\n\n“I say let him look,” One of the Stalliongradians spoke up. “If Starlight trusts him, I don’t see why we shouldn’t too.”\n\nStarlight nodded at the stallion and levitated a sealed telegram over to Velvet. He took the paper in his hooves and raised an eyebrow at Starlight.\n\n“The Los Pegasus cell intercepted this a week ago. We’ve already decoded it as best we can, but I want to see if you can derive any meaning from these last few sentences,” She instructed, gesturing to a jumbled mess of symbols."

 paxsolaris.215.d:0 "He didn’t recognise this code, but it wasn’t like the Los Pegasus command were going to give some nopony from the Heartland region their codebook. So Velvet would have to decode this message the old-fashioned way. A daunting task for most ponies. But Velvet hadn’t spent two years picking apart the nearly-illegible Changeling script without learning a thing or two.\n\n“It’s a military requisition order,” Velvet said after a long pause. “High Command wants Los Pegasus to facilitate the transfer of troops from the Heartland to the Northwest.”\n\nStarlight nodded. “That confirms what our scouts have reported. Daybreaker wants to secure the frontiers so badly she’s left her heart wide open. And we intend to exploit her ambition.”\n\n“Da! We will skewer the monarch!” The Stalliongradian spoke up.\n\nThe thestral shook his head. “This empire is more than just one pony. It is an institution. We must uproot it at the base.”\n\n“We can’t just wipe out the entirety of Canterlot,” One of the anarchists scoffed. “Just focus on their military high command. Without a military, Daybreaker’s empire will crumble around her.”\n\n“Why should we not wipe out the sun-worshippers?” The thestral shot back.\n\n“Alright, that’s enough!” Starlight shouted, causing the room to fall silent. “We will decide on our target like civilised ponies. And no, Umbra, we will not be killing civilians if we can avoid it.”\n\nThe thestral glared at her, but he didn’t comment.\n\nSeeing the hostility in the room, Starlight sighed and turned to Velvet. “Well, what do you think we should do?

Starlight and Trixie had put them through one hell of a training regime the past few weeks. Sparking Flame saw what he was doing and smirked. “Enjoying bootcamp, greenhorn?”\n\n“Oh buck off, it’s not my fault I had a desk job,” Velvet shot back, lightly punching the unicorn. Sparking began to laugh, but the sound died in his throat as the two unicorn mares stepped up to the podium.\n\n“The Great and Powerful Trixie appreciates all of you being here today,” Trixie spoke, pouring emotion into every word like a true stage performer. “Your efforts have not been for naught, for we will now reveal to you our brilliant and most cunning plan to bring the solar tyrant down!”\n\nStarlight nodded to Trixie and stepped past her. “What my friend says is true. [THIS.GetNameDef] is vulnerable. Their military is bloated and unprepared for fighting internal dissent. But it will not take them long to adapt, so we must strike quickly. I have spoken with the leaders of resistance cells across the country and they have agreed with my plan. All that’s left is to prepare our attack. We have the strength. We have the courage! And so we will strike at the very heart of this tyrannical empire while it remains vulnerable. Friends and comrades, we will strike at Canterlot, eliminate Daybreaker’s high command and destroy the tyrant herself!”\n\nThe words seemed to hang in the air for a while, before cheers erupted from the crowd.

It sounded like a suicide plan. But if Starlight thought they could pull it off, he was inclined to believe her.\n\nBy the Empress, he needed a drink. But first he needed to draft their defensive plan.\n\nIt went without saying that he would need to call in the military. Canterlot itself would need the most defenses, but for a solid defence checkpoints in the surrounding states would be required.\n\nBut the military wasn’t here. Daybreaker had ordered them to the empire’s frontiers to defend against foreign invasion. It would be almost impossible to muster this many troops on such short notice. He could ease the burden by drawing civilian garrisons from surrounding states, but that could leave the Heartland defenceless. If anything were to happen to the unprotected states, they would blame Daybreaker for throwing them to timberwolves to save Canterlot elites.\n\nThe Cabinet Secretary sighed.

Not all ponies may be proud of their past.”\n\n“We would know, right?” Trixie laughed briefly, but the laughter died when she saw the serious look on Starlight’s face. Trixie sighed and trotted over to the unicorn. “Look, I know you want to do the right thing and create that harmonist utopia you dream of. But this is the real world. We must make some sacrifices. Unless we want to be up to our horns in Daybreaker spies, we at least need background checks.”\n\nStarlight gave a long sigh, then nodded."

 paxsolaris.217.t:0 "Traitors Among Us"
 paxsolaris.217.d:0 "Velvet Arrow and Sparking Flame waited in nervous silence, shivering in the frosty morning air with the other resistance members. Soldiers had roused them from their sleep at the crack of dawn, and it didn’t take a genius to figure out why. Halfway into their advance on the capital, orders had come in that they were to move on Whinnyapolis instead. While others had been confused, Velvet had been relieved. He hadn’t been given the chance to warn Dotted Line before the attack on Whinnyapolis began, but the resistance looting arms warehouses was an infinitely better outcome to the destruction of Canterlot. But Starlight must have narrowed the leak to the Whinnyapolis cell. And now she had come to plug it.\n\nThe unicorn stepped onto the podium to deliver the news. But before she could even open her mouth, a pony shouted over the heads of the crowd. “Hey, what gives? I thought you said we were marching on Canterlot!”\n\n“That’s what I came here to talk about. Our spies in Canterlot reported a massive military buildup around the city. Daybreaker drew forces from all across Equestria to fortify her capital. Going forth with our plan would’ve been suicide.”\n\n“You said the city would be defenceless!” The pony cried.\n\nFor a brief moment, Starlight looked like she’d aged two decades. Then she was back to being the confident and in-control resistance leader.\n\n“It was. But Daybreaker caught word of our attack. And that means we have a spy,” Starlight told them. The crowd of ponies began whispering loudly, glancing at their neighbours with suspicious eyes. Starlight nodded. “Yes, one of you is a traitor.”"

 paxsolaris.218.t:0 "Sparking Flame Speaks Up"
 paxsolaris.218.d:0 "While Velvet seized up like a rabbit in the path of a stampede, Sparking Flame remained calm. He'd been expecting this. Starlight and Trixie were smart enough to put two and two together. It wouldn’t take them long to identify both stallions as loyalists...\n\n“Rest assured, we will conduct background checks into everypony,” Starlight continued her announcement. “These will remain strictly confidential, but until then nopony may leave this camp.”\n\n...Unless Sparking did something about it.\n\n“Let me save you the effort,” He muscled his way through the crowd of ponies. The soldiers raised their guns as he approached, but Starlight commanded them to stand down. Only when he was right before Starlight did he speak again. “I’m the spy.”\n\nShocked gasps rang out across the crowd. Starlight was staring at him in disbelief, a look of betrayal written on her face.\n\n“But why?” She asked after a long moment. “What could Daybreaker have possibly offered you? And why reveal yourself?”\n\nSparking Flame rolled his eyes. “Even a cursory glance at my background would be enough to label me as a loyalist. Maybe you’d find out my father was a solar priest. Maybe you’d learn the regiment I was part of now serves in the Imperial Royal Guard. Maybe you’d dig up a picture of me and Dotted Line from my wedding. You’d find out, eventually. But I refuse to give you the privilege of getting rid of me quietly.”\n\nHe turned to the crowd of ponies, who were all staring up at him in shocked disbelief. A smile appeared on the unicorn’s face. He’d been waiting for this moment for weeks.\n\n“Look at you. Traitors to the core. You kill fellow ponies to restore a system that would let monsters like Chrysalis and Sombra slaughter us. I never betrayed you, because I was never loyal to you. How could I be loyal to those who would willingly keep ponykind divided and squabbling under a republic that would offer nothing but empty platitudes? Prosperity and safety comes from ponies working together under the guidance of a firm hoof, and that is why your kind will never win!”"

 paxsolaris.219.d:0 "Two of Starlight’s guards pounced on him, slamming a magic suppressor on his horn. Sparking offered no resistance as they tightened the strap under his chin then threw him at Starlight’s hooves.\n\n“I had sincerely hoped I could reason with you,” Starlight sighed, giving him a disappointed look. She gestured to two of her guards. “Deal with this madstallion how you see fit. Just... make it quick. Please.”\n\nThe guards nodded and cuffed Sparking’s forelegs to their own. But if the orange stallion was displeased, he didn’t show it. Starlight watched him be dragged off, sad but relieved she’d caught the spy so easily.\n\nSparking Flame kept pace behind the earth pony and pegasus guards, feeling the straps of the magic suppressor digging into his neck. Only when they had made it to the forest did he speak up again. “Were either of you in a mage company?”\n\n“What do you think?” The pegasus shot back, ruffling her wings for emphasis.\n\n“No, I suppose not. Pity. You’d never meet finer ponies. I don’t mean to brag, but I was part of a particularly elite company. The Canterlot 43rd.”\n\n“Oh will you shut up!” The earth pony guard demanded. “I wouldn’t be smiling if I was you. Starlight may want us to be merciful, but I’m tempted to just shoot your kneecaps and leave you to the timberwolves.”\n\n“They taught us a pretty useful skill,” Sparking continued, ignoring the outburst. He raised his hoof to his chin. “It’s not something I’m fond of doing. But when the situation demands it...”\n\nA sickening crack pierced the silence. The two guards spun around to see Sparking Flame shaking the magic suppressor off his horn, his jaw hanging freely. The pegasus squeezed her trigger, but her shots bounced off an orange shield and into the forest. Sparking grabbed the earth pony by her back legs in a telekinetic grip then swung her at the pegasus, sending both guards into a tree. Before either of them could recover a bolt of magical fire engulfed the duo. When the light faded, all that remained of the guards were cooling piles of ash.\n\nSparking Flame stepped around the remains, picking up the dropped rifles as he passed. He trotted through the forest, eventually coming across the radio he’d hidden in a withered tree all those weeks ago."

 paxsolaris.220.d:0 "Sunset Shimmer watched as Daybreaker levitated the teacup to her lips and took a dainty sip, sighing in contentment. It would seem her transformation had not dulled her love for tea. Sunset took a sip from her own cup. Truthfully, she had never cared for her mentor’s favourite drink. But Sunset would take any opportunity to spend time with her mother figure.\n\n“I am glad you could spare the time to join me, Sunset. I understand your work reforming the Imperial Royal Guard into a more useful organisation has left you quite busy as of late.”\n\n“It is of no concern, your majesty,” Sunset bowed her head. “I’m glad to do my part in improving [THIS.GetNameDef].”\n\n“And you are doing a fine job,” Daybreaker smiled, making Sunset feel warm and fuzzy inside. “They will soon be ready to carry out my will. But until then, I have a job for you. I trust you have heard rumours of my latest project?”\n\n“I may have heard of it,” Sunset replied. The Imperial Inquisition was supposed to be top secret until they were ready to be unveiled. But some ponies had a terrible habit of running their mouths.\n\n“Good, then you know how important this project is. I need you to conduct a top-to-bottom audit of the Imperial Inquisition before we take action against Starlight’s band of traitors. All our efforts would be wasted if Starlight has managed to slip a spy into the organisation.”\n\nSunset took another sip of tea and nodded. “A valid concern. We cannot allow the Inquisition to be infested with traitors like S.M.I.L.E.”\n\n“My thoughts exactly. You may coordinate efforts with Dotted Line. He is trustworthy. Anypony else must be considered a suspect. I’ll leave you to decide what should be done with any traitors you find.”"

Sparking Flame sniggered at the sight and offered another beer to the stallion while he sipped his own through a straw. It was the only way he could drink with his jaw still in a cast.\n\n“Did you really say that in front of Starlight Glimmer?” Dotted finally managed to say. Sparking nodded and the grey unicorn burst into another fit of laughter. “You’re a bloody madmare. I don’t think my Inquisition could afford another stallion like you in our ranks.”\n\n“Ah, but it’s not your Inquisition anymore, is it?” Sparking shot back. “Last I heard, you’re serving out your last week before returning to the Civil Service.”\n\n“Oh yes, my ‘demotion’,” Dotted rolled his eyes. “I sure will miss the long hours and constant stress of managing an entire intelligence agency by myself. I tell you, when I got the news I was so shocked my jaw hit the floor.”\n\n“Oh go fu- AH!” Sparking cried out as he accidentally moved his broken jaw. He glared as Dotted Line laughed at his discomfort. But that laughter died when he spotted the figure standing in the doorway.\n\n“Drinking on the job?” Sunset Shimmer scowled at the two stallions. “You’re supposed to be hunting the resistance.”\n\nDotted Line shivered at the sight of the mare. Sunset Shimmer had shown up from gods knows where and had already been granted command over the entire Imperial Royal Guard. She had wasted no time in reforming them into the cold and merciless executors of Daybreaker’s will. The rumours he’d heard about what the Royal Guard had been turned into were enough to make even him nervous.\n\n“Leave us,” Sunset ordered. Sparking Flame gave his friend a sympathetic look then quickly left, not wishing to invoke Sunset’s ire. Now alone, Sunset turned to the grey stallion. “The Empress has called for a complete audit of all Inquisitorial personnel. You will provide me with files on everypony who works here.”\n\n“I do hope the Empress is not displeased by the delay this audit will cause.”\n\n“Leave Daybreaker to me. Just get the files sorted. Expect my arrival early tomorrow morning.”\n\n“How detailed do you want these files?” Dotted Line asked. “You must remember that we are on a time schedule. If we spend too long hunting traitors in the Inquisition we give the traitors abroad time to strengthen themselves.”"

Not bothering to knock, Sunset flung open his door.\n\nThe grey stallion leapt up in shock. “What is the meaning of this!?”\n\nSunset scowled. “You’re smart enough to know why I’m here. There was an information leak. Starlight Glimmer and Trixie Lulamoon were given advanced warning about our attack, that’s why they managed to evacuate so many ponies. The Imperial Royal Guards are clean. That leaves your Inquisition as the weak leak.”\n\n“Er, yes. I have been conducting a very thorough second audit and have located the spy,” Dotted told her. “I was just about to give the arrest order before you barged in here.”\n\n“It’s an Imperial Royal Guard matter now. Show me to the spy’s office,” Sunset commanded.\n\nDotted Line sighed. “Very well then. Though I would appreciate it if you let me manage Inquisitorial affairs.”\n\n“Your concern is noted and disregarded,” Sunset snapped back. She commanded her two soldiers to follow Dotted Line as he led them through the Inquisition’s headquarters. Trailing behind, Sunset took the moment to survey the ponies she passed. They flinched away when her gaze fell upon them.\n\nFinally they arrived at an office. The blinds were closed and the door locked. Sunset wasted no time blasting the door off and marching inside, but what she saw gave her pause. A pegasus stallion hung in the middle of the room, dangling from the ceiling by a piece of rope tied around his neck.\n\n“Damn it all, he took his own life,” Dotted Line sighed. “He must have known something he didn’t want us torturing out of him.”\n\nBut Sunset had spotted a piece of paper tied to the stallion’s wing. She levitated it to her eyes and began reading. As she read, the unicorn mare began to tremble with rage. Embers flaked off the letter as it vibrated in her magical grip. In a burst of fire the letter was gone and Sunset let the ashes lazily drift to the floor.\n\n“What did it say?” Dotted Line asked.\n\n“Never mind that. Just make sure this doesn’t happen again, or it’ll be your head on the chopping block,” Sunset glared at the stallion. She turned to her two guards and gestured to the hanging pegasus."

She could hear a deafening roar as the fire greedily sucked oxygen to fuel its might, lifting the alicorn into the air. Unable to contain herself, Celestia began to laugh. Never had she felt such a strong connection to the sun. She could feel its fury. Taste its strength. Everything made sense now. There was no friendship without strength. No peace without war. No harmony without order. Yes, this was Celestia’s destiny! To wield the power of the sun to bring destruction upon all those who dared to harm her precious children!\n\nAs the princess accepted her fate, the inferno doubled in strength, shining brighter than anything had ever shone before. Such power did not deserve to be wielded by a weak creature like Celestia. With this silent command, the flames within the alicorn’s heart shot outwards, responding to the will of their goddess and transforming her body. Her bones grew and hardened. Her blood boiled away, replaced by pure crimson magic. Finally the colour was scoured from her hair, leaving only purifying fire.\n\nThe energy exploded outwards, vaporising the lingering vestiges of Celesita and painting the floor a sooty black. The peaceful matron of Equestria was gone. All her gentle softness had been burnt away. In her place was a towering being of radiance and power, hovering in the air as the last of the crimson energy danced around her limbs. As Daybreaker touched down, she opened her burning eyes and began to cackle madly, revelling as she felt the world itself tremble at the sound. Never had the solar deity felt more alive!\n\nShe reached out with her magic, grabbing the twisted and molten remnants of her diadem and shaping it into a jagged crown deserving of the goddess made flesh. Daybreaker could feel power unlike anything she had ever felt before. For a brief moment, the world was still. Ponies, Griffons and Zebras alike were compelled into silence as Daybreaker roared her triumph to the heavens. Light flooded the world as Daybreaker seized the sun and forced it high into the heavens. It was a few minutes early, but Daybreaker did not care.

The moon cast a baleful silver light over the princess, mocking her with its glow. Celestia met its gaze with equal parts fury and grief.\n\nBut that grief was not for Luna. After being forced to endure the horrors of civil war twice at the hooves of Nightmare Moon, the last spark of sisterly affection in her heart had been snuffed out. Even with her millennia of wisdom, Celestia could see no future in forgiving Luna a second time. When they next met, it would end with one of them dead by the other’s hoof. And Celestia no longer had any reservations about ending the life of the creature that once pretended to love her.\n\nNo, her grief was for all her little ponies slain in Luna’s petulant temper tantrum. They were the victims here. Those batpony vermin had put thousands of innocent ponies to the sword. With each report she read on the atrocities committed by Luna’s army, Celestia felt her heart break just a little bit more. Worse was the knowledge that Celestia herself had allowed these events to come to pass. Luna had made Celestia responsible for the slaughter of her own subjects by tricking the princess into trusting her. And for that she hated her all the more. Never had she felt such hatred for another living being. Not Discord, not Tirek and not even Sombra. The hatred she felt for her own sister eclipsed it all.\n\nCelestia gripped the moon in her magic, trying to force it beneath the horizon.

When they’d agreed to meet this mysterious benefactor, Mist Glade had been expecting to arrive at some shady bar. Not a manor that would put the towers of Canterlot to shame.\n\nBut Silver Glade didn’t share his brother’s enthusiasm. “Don’t get too comfortable. These arms dealers are not to be trusted. Did you see how many guards they had around this place? Nopony has this much security unless they’re involved in something seriously illegal.”\n\nMist Glade raised an eyebrow. “Like sponsoring rebel militias? I can’t blame them for investing in extra security. Besides, Luna herself led us here with a dream. And has she ever led us astray?”\n\n“Well, no,” Silver Glade admitted.\n\n“I’ll keep an eye out for anything suspicious. But you need to relax.

Two earth pony guards stepped out and nodded to the thestrals. “He is ready to see you now.”\n\nThe brothers stood up and followed the guards out of the lobby further into the manor. They came to a set of large oak doors that swung open automatically as the group approached. The two guards stood to either side of the doorway, letting the thestral duo enter. Mist Glade raised an eyebrow as he passed them. Were they seriously going to leave their boss unprotected?\n\nBut those thoughts died as he took in the vast office. The floor was polished wood, lined with a thin red carpet. Display cabinets and shelves lined the walls, filled with carved urns and ancient helmets neither brother could even hope to identify. At one side of the room there was a grey pegasus stallion staring intently at a black knife. The thestrals waited in awkward silence, unsure if the pegasus would take offence if they disturbed him. Luckily for them, it was the pegasus who spoke up first."

 paxsolaris.303.d:0 "“There wouldn’t be many thestrals that aren’t, sir,” Mist Glade tried to keep his voice from wavering. His earlier confidence seemed to have deserted him.\n\n“Ah, of course,” The pegasus nodded, never taking his eyes from the knife. “Your kind has quite the history with the Neighua. I’m sure you’ll recognise what this is?”\n\nThe thestrals shuffled closer to get a better look at the knife. It was pitch black, just shorter than a foreleg. The hilt was made from gold, woven tightly around the base of the black crystal blade in swirling sun patterns. The hilt was unblemished, but the blade was covered in a brown flakey substance.\n\n“I’m sorry, I’m not sure what that is,” Silver Glade spoke up.\n\n“Figures. This is a Neighua sacrificial knife from the pre-unification days. Made out of pure obsidian harvested from the fiery maw of Mt Poncatepetl itself. Enchanted by unicorn priests to be free from wear and the ravages of time. This blade is as sharp today as it was two thousand years ago. Just think, how many lives were snuffed out by this knife? How much blood stained those jungle temples?”\n\nMist and Silver shared a nervous look. The stallion’s tone remained neutral, but his orange eyes betrayed a deep fascination. He finally glanced up from the knife to look at the two thestrals.\n\n“You are the thestrals from Hollow Shades? I know what you seek. And it will be provided, on one condition: you allow my men to participate in the fighting.”\n\nMist Glade tried to hide his unease. He didn’t recall telling the pegasus or his butler they were from the Hollow Shades militia. The thestral pushed his thoughts aside, reasoning that Princess Luna must have visited the pegasus in a dream and told him to expect them.\n\n“Why would you want to participate?” Silver Glade asked.\n\n“Call it an investment. If your militia were to be defeated, there would be investigations. And I would never receive my payment.”\n\nThat did make sense, but Mist Glade still felt uneasy. Some subconscious instinct was screaming at him to run. To flee this manor and never return. He ignored the feeling and shared a silent conversation with his brother. Finally, Mist Glade spoke to the stallion."

 paxsolaris.304.d:0 "“That is unfortunate,” The pegasus murmured, his voice smoothe and nonplussed. The two guards from the doorway stepped into the room and took a spot either side of the thestrals. Mist Glade stepped back cautiously. Their rifles were a bit too close for comfort.\n\n“I am sorry we could not reach an arrangement,” The pegasus told them, his orange eyes flashing dangerously. He took a seat at his desk and leaned back in his chair. “But I wish you well in your endeavors. Ember. Pumice. Could you please escort these two outside? I have nothing more to discuss with them.”\n\nThe two guards practically herded them outside. Just as the oak door was about to swing close, the pegasus spoke up again.\n\n“Be sure to escort them out via the back entrance.”"

Damn it all, where was his brother with the reinforcements he’d been promised? Celestia’s guards were slaughtering them!\n\nNo sooner had the thought crossed his mind did a loud boom sound out through the forest. A few seconds later, the trees ahead of Silver Glade were obliterated in an explosion of fire and debris. Orders were shouted and the Royal Guards began a tactical retreat, giving Silver Glade a moment of respite.\n\n“By the moon, what happened to you?” A voice came from behind him. Silver turned and saw Mist Glade staring at him in mute shock. Bodies of thestrals littered the ground around him, but Silver Glade stood tall.\n\n“I’ll tell you what happened. Your arms dealers screwed us!” Silver Glade shouted. The pegasus stallion had followed through on his word and delivered rifles, ammunition and even a few small artillery pieces to Hollow Shades, along with a brigade’s worth of mercenaries. But the second the fighting had picked up, those mercenaries were nowhere to be seen, leaving Silver Glade’s small company to hold off the Royal Guards all alone.\n\nMist Glade growled. “They screwed me too. Poor Shadow Skies had to drag that cannon here by hoof since those mercenaries didn’t bring the truck they promised. That’s why we were so late.”\n\n“Well we’ve got the guns now. I say once this is all over we give that sleazy pegasus-” The words died in Silver Glade’s throat. He looked past his brother, back toward Hollow Shades. Against the black of night, the thestral could faintly see a faint orange light through the trees.\n\nFire.\n\n“Sweet Luna, the town is burning!” Silver Glade shouted.\n\nMist Glade turned pale, staring at the orange glow in mute horror."

 paxsolaris.306.d:0 "It was a scene from his darkest nightmare. Flames were consuming the town, filling the air with noxious smoke that burned their lungs with every breath. The winds howled through the forest, feeding the inferno but doing nothing to stifle the screams.\n\nOne of the townsfolk sprinted over to the returning militia. “Thank Luna you’re here! You need to help us! Those mercenaries, they’re killing everypony!”\n\n“Calm down, you saying the mercenaries are responsible for this?” Mist Glade asked.\n\n“As soon as the Royal Guard were driven out, they started attacking us. They’ve gathered all the thestrals to the town square and burnt the rest to cover their tracks. Please, you need to help them! My sister is-”\n\n“Say no more, we’ll fly over and deal with these traitors,” Mist Glade told him. He gripped his rifle and took off, Silver Glade and the rest of the unit following just behind. A shimmering dome of yellow light could be spotted at the centre of town. And just past it, rows upon rows of thestrals forced to the ground at gunpoint by the mercenaries.\n\n“Alright stallions. Take position in the clouds and be ready to shoot down that shield on my-” But Mist Glade didn’t get the chance to finish his order. A soldier behind him cried out in pain as a bullet sliced through his shoulder, sending him spiralling down into the inferno below.\n\nPegasi leapt out of the clouds, slaughtering the small unit with a hail of rifle fire. Silver Glade never even had the chance to raise his guns before blinding pain ignited in his shoulder. Mist Glade went down first, tackled by a pegasus mare. Then something impacted his helmet. There was a moment of weightlessness before he hit the ground painfully, knocking his head against the hard ground."

 paxsolaris.307.t:0 "The Order of the Purifying Sun"
 paxsolaris.307.d:0 "Silver Glade awoke to the feeling of being dragged across the ground. He forced his eyes open and was met with the soulless black lenses of a white gasmask. The thestral tried to struggle, but the white-robed pegasus had too tight a grip.\n\n“If you think you can torture information out of me, you’ve got another thing coming!” Silver Glade spat. But the pegasi remained silent. It was then Silver Glade heard the chanting. A dull sound echoing through the dark forest. The light of the fires consuming the town illuminated a circle of ponies, all chanting in perfect sync. Silver Glade redoubled his efforts to escape at the sight of them .\n\nHe watched in mute horror as Mist Glade was dragged to a makeshift altar at the centre of the circle. A single white-robed stallion loomed over the thestral, holding a black knife over his heart. Mist Glade screamed as the blade pierced his torso, spilling blood across the town square.\n\nTears sprung to Silver Glade’s eyes as the leader of the congregation kicked the body of his brother off the altar. It fell to the ground in an undignified heap. Runes carved into the ground flared up with a brilliant orange light, vanishing the body and the blood still staining the altar in a burst of magical fire.\n\n“Bring me the next sacrifice,” The figure commanded.\n\nThe pegasi dragged Silver Glade into the circle, ignoring his struggles and pleas. They slammed him back-first into the altar. The thestral tried to get up, but it was like some invisible force was pinning him down.\n\n“Please, have mercy!” He begged, his heart now beating in time with the chants.\n\n“With this blood, we quench your thirst,” The leader murmured, raising a black and gold knife above his next victim. “With this flesh, we sate your hunger. With this death, we bring you life!”\n\nThe knife plunged down, and Silver Glade knew no more.\n\n“Rise, Chalchiuhtl!”"

 paxsolaris.308.d:0 "It was the pegasi scouts that spotted it first. At first the news had relieved the Royal Guards. But as they approached the blackened remains of what was once Hollow Shades, that relief had given way to dread. The thestral insurgents may have disappeared, but whatever wiped out this town so thoroughly could still be lurking in the thick forest.\n\nBut there was no signs of anypony. The town looked as if no sentient creature had stepped hoof in it for centuries. Blackened wood had rotted away under countless seasons, leaving only the sturdiest skeletons of homes remaining. The unicorns confirmed as much after with a simple magical test. These ruins were centuries old and yet the town had been standing proud and new only a few months prior. Something horrible had happened here. Each guard could feel it in their bones. The air hummed with untold secrets begging to be revealed.\n\nThey fled the ruined town quickly, leaving it to rot in the dark with its secrets forever lost to the world."
 paxsolaris.309.d:0 "“I tell you what, I’ll be happy to see Ma and Pa again,” Shadow Fall watched the trees pass by out the back of the troop transport with a wistful sigh.\n\n“Don’t get too comfortable,” Selene reminded him. “Hollow Shades went dark weeks ago. For all we know, Celestia’s army could be waiting for us.”\n\nThe truck lurched to the side, throwing the two thestrals off their seats. Sergeant Dusk Wind tapped the front of the truck angrily. “What gives? Can’t you imbeciles keep us on the road?”\n\n“This is the road! The whole thing is overgrown! I think we’ll have to continue on hoof.”\n\nThe soldiers groaned at the news. One by one they leapt off the truck, stretching their legs at the edge of the forest. Shadow Fall glanced ahead at the path he knew the road should be, only to find dense foliage. How had this grown in only a few months?\n\n“Shadow Fall,” Dusk Wind singled him out. “You know this forest best. Take Selene and fly ahead.”\n\n“Yes, sir!” Shadow Fall saluted. He nodded at Selene and the two thestrals leapt into the air, making a beeline for Hollow Shades. But despite his best efforts, Shadow Fall couldn’t spot his hometown. How could it be so concealed? Just as he was about to give up, he spotted a small break in the canopies.\n\nThe thestral landed in the clearing and felt his blood turn to ice. Through the dense foliage, Shadow Fall could just make out the ruins of buildings. He recognised them.\n\n“What is this place?” Selene finally spoke up, shivering slightly.\n\n“Hollow Shades,” Shadow Fall replied, trying to swallow the lump in his throat. \n\n“Impossible,” Selene replied. She tapped one of the blackened beams with her hoof. “These beams have to be at least a century old. Maybe more.”\n\nShe was right. This place looked like it had been abandoned for centuries. Only the brickwork and structural beams remained. Everything else had rotted away or been reclaimed by the forest. And yet only a month ago he’d been helping Mist and Silver Glade prepare for the uprising. But his heart told him they were gone, never to return along with the rest of Hollow Shades.\n\n“That’s where Blue Moon used to sell fruit pies. Over there is the school house,” Shadow Fall wiped a tear from his eye. “And that’s the home I grew up in. This is Hollow Shades. Or at least, it was.”\n\nBoth thestrals shivered as a cold wind blew through the husk of a town. It almost seemed to beckon to them, crying out against its fate. Shadow Fall tried to listen, but the feeling disappeared. He turned back to Selene, a look of horrified disbelief on his face."

She slumped down at the balcony, glaring up at the moon with all of her grief and fury. A part of Celestia still wanted to give Luna the benefit of the doubt. But the evidence against her sister was mounting.\n\nDid Luna think her senile? Did she believe a millennia of guiding ponykind towards utopia had left Celestia unable to spot a lie when she saw one? Luna is the undisputed master of the dream realm, but she expects Celestia to believe that the disembodied spirit of Nightmare Moon could organise this army without her knowledge?\n\nHow desperately Celestia wished she could have things back to the way they used to be. But it seemed Luna was just as determined to tear it all down as she was one thousand years ago. Her actions would once again lead ponykind to ruin. But Celestia would be damned if she allowed Luna to force another decade of strife onto her ponies. This time, she would not ignore the signs. She had Twilight and the Elements, they could exorcise Luna of these lingering demons. Then they could finally be sisters again. And if not…\n\nCelestia would be forced to take extreme measures.\n\nTears ran down her face. Celestia narrowed her eyes and they boiled away with a faint hiss. There was no room for these feelings. Her nation was on the brink of civil war. Now more than ever did ponykind need Celestia to be strong. And if that meant banishing her sister for another thousand years..."

Under its baleful light, even Celestia felt despair clutch her heart. But the moon did not show her a nightmare. How could it, when her nightmare had become reality?\n\nCelestia reached out with her magic, doing whatever she could to fight back against the blood moon’s influence. She knew where this magic was coming from. She could sense the nexus of darkness that had gathered over Manehattan and feel its familiar sting. Why did Luna have to put her through this again? Tears streamed down Celestia’s face as she fought the nightmare Luna had become for ponykind’s sanity.\n\nThe princess snarled and poured more power into the spell. She threw all her pain and fury at this evil curse and felt it crack. A brilliant beam of golden light shot from her horn, outshining even the horrible red light of the moon. Even when the effort caused her mane to burst into flames, Celestia didn’t give up. Finally the curse gave way and Celestia scoured the moon’s surface, leaving it a pure white.\n\nShe opened her eyes and found the palace ground around her had been melted by the fury of her magic. Ponies looked around with dazed expressions, glancing between the purified moon and Celestia. The alicorn’s skin glowed as if illuminated from within by a roiling inferno. Celestia turned to the nearest royal guard.\n\n“Order an immediate evacuation of the city. Nightmare Moon is coming. She cannot ignore this challenge to her dominion over the night.”\n\nThe guard saluted, but Celestia had already left. She teleported to the foot of the royal palace and summoned her ancient battle regalia in preparation for her sister's arrival. The princess rested her warhammer on the marble floor and waited."

Nightmare Moon landed gracefully at the other end of the courtyard, cackling like a madmare. She turned her baleful gaze to her sister and smirked.\n\n“There is no need to be so glum, dear sister. Equestria is merely receiving a better and more powerful ruler!”\n\n“Why sister?” Celestia asked, ignoring the jab. “Why are you doing this?”\n\nNightmare Moon sneered. “Don’t act like you care! You’re stuck in your perfect little world where everypony loves you and nothing bad ever happens. You don’t care about me and you never have!”\n\n“That’s not true, Luna,” Celestia took a step closer to the dark alicorn, tears brimming in her eyes. “I love you. Please don’t do this again. It’s not too late to turn back.”\n\n“Oh you love me?” Nightmare Moon rolled her eyes. “Then explain to me why after a thousand years I am still just as shunned!”\n\nCelestia sighted. She wished Luna could just be reasonable. Celestia was willing to give her sister a third chance, but her patience was beginning to wear thin. Luna caused her nothing but pain. She had suffered a thousand years of loneliness because of Luna. She had been forced to rule Equestria alone because of Luna. And even after spending countless centuries planning for Luna’s return so they could be sisters once more she seemed determined to ruin everything Celestia had worked so hard for.

Then her face contorted into a hateful glare. “How dare you! You know nothing of what it’s like to be shunned! You call me petty like you don’t hog attention like the selfish control freak you are!”\n\n“Selfish? You think you have the right to call me selfish? I have sacrificed more for this nation that you could even begin imagine. I’ve suffered pain, ridicule and more stress than anypony could experience in a thousand lifetimes! So excuse me for not being sympathetic because ponies don’t think your reflective ball is as good as the thing that gives them life.”\n\nSomething angry stirred in Celestia’s heart. Something that begged for release. She had felt this feeling many times before. And for the first time in her long life, Celestia considered giving in.

A hollow, mocking laughter began to echo across Canterlot.\n\nThe energy exploded outwards, painting the floor a sooty black. Nightmare Moon grunted as the force of the explosion impacted her shield. The light faded and she could finally see the demon of fire her sister had become.\n\nShe was tall. Taller than Celestia or any alicorn had ever been. Her mane and tail were tongues of fire angrily lashing out at the surrounding air. As the fire subsided, Celestia opened her wrathful eyes. And for the first time in many years, Nightmare Moon felt fear.\n\nCelestia roared her triumph to the heavens, her aura flaring up as she fed it her hate. Finally, she turned her gaze back to Nightmare Moon.

The door was flung open by an aura of blue magic, letting a nervous thestral guard approach the night queen.\n\n“Why have you disturbed me?” A cold voice came from the black alicorn at the other end of the room.\n\n“My Queen, the generals are waiting for you,” Dusk Wind said, cautiously trotting to where Nightmare Moon sat on a lavish Zebrican rug. Her slitted eyes were closed and she took long, deep breaths. Were it not for the glowing of her horn, Dusk would have thought the alicorn asleep.\n\n“Do you think I need to sign off on every inane decision? Leave me. I have important matters to attend to,” Nightmare Moon snapped back. She kept her eyes firmly shut and reached out across the dream world. Something wasn’t right. The dream world was never this turbulent. Nightmare Moon could feel a sinister anger poisoning the peaceful landscape.\n\n“They were very exact about their request, your majesty. There have been... developments on the frontline.”\n\nNightmare Moon felt her temper flare. “Did I stutter? Leave me!”\n\nThe thestral hurried out of the bedroom, leaving the alicorn to her task. She knew who was responsible for this poison. But Nightmare Moon struggled to believe it. Celestia was not the serene and infallible monarch ponykind portrayed her as. Nightmare Moon would know, she had been the target of Celestia’s hatred many times before. But this was different. Celestia’s magic didn’t just want to burn Nightmare Moon out of the dream world. It wanted to wipe her from reality itself.\n\nNightmare Moon probed deeper and to her surprise felt Celestia’s mental barriers give way. She immediately suspected a trap. Celestia would never give any creature access to her mind. But if Celestia wanted to show her something, Nightmare Moon would not stop her. She dived into Celestia’s mind, worming through an endless sea of memories to arrive at the very core of the solar alicorn’s psyche. This was the part of Celestia that underpinned her personality. It contained her deepest desires and her greatest fears. Nightmare Moon grinned as she extended her consciousness towards the mass of psychic energy. Celestia was a fool to believe Nightmare Moon wouldn’t take this chance to learn the true nature of her foe. The dark alicorn closed the metaphorical distance and plunged into Celestia’s mind."

With the last of her inhibitions gone, there was nothing to stop Daybreaker from scouring away the rot that still lingered in her nation. She stormed through the palace, passing terrified servants as she made her way to the briefing room where she knew Luna would be meeting with the High Command.\n\nThe guards posted to the briefing room backed away in horror as Daybreaker approached. They tried to raise their rifles, but a pleasant warmth put a stop to their efforts.\n\n“You would not raise your weapons against your empress, would you?” Daybreaker asked.\n\n“Princess? Is that you?” One of the guards stammered.\n\nDaybreaker grinned, revealing her sharpened fangs. “Not anymore, my little pony.”\n\nThe guard struggled to connect the image of the princess he’d served his entire life to the fiery alicorn that stood before him. Her coat was the same pale white, yet it now shone with an unnatural glow. The shape of her face was familiar and yet so different. All the features were the same, but where Celestia had always appeared serene and peaceful, this alicorn looked triumphant and predatory. But it was the eyes that told the guard everything he needed to know. The calming purple of her eyes were gone, replaced by a maelstrom of hateful fire.\n\nBut despite her terrifying appearance, he felt safe. Those eyes held untold amounts of malice, but it was not directed towards him. He had seen this look in the faces of the soldiers on the frontline. The look of a pony who would lay down their lives so others would never experience the pain they felt. Everything clicked into place and the guards bowed deeply, letting Daybreaker pass.\n\n“Forgive me, my empress.”\n\nDaybreaker smiled and flung the doors open with her crimson magic. Silence fell across the room as each pony turned to Daybreaker, their eyes widening in disbelief. Luna was the first to break the silence, a look of petrified horror on her face."

One can only watch their children be slaughtered for so long before they realise their limitless power is wasted hosting tea parties for Equestria’s enemies.”\n\n“You don’t have to do this!” Luna begged, her eyes wide and tearful. “You don’t have to make the same mistake I did. Whatever is causing you this pain, we can deal with it together. Please Tia, stop this madness!”\n\nDaybreaker faltered a step. Then she snarled, the fire in her mane doubling in intensity. “Do not call me that! Celestia was a weak and cowardly fool. She would send ponies to the slaughter but wouldn't lift a hoof to force the changes necessary to give them the best chances of victory. They died while she wasted time in Canterlot appeasing selfish parasites. But the days of me being a weak and distant ruler are over. From this day forward, I will be the protector, mother and goddess of ponies until the sun burns out! They will know me as Daybreaker: Empress of Ponykind and the scourge of its foes!”\n\n“No! Celestia was- IS stronger than you!” Luna shot back, blinking tears out of her eyes as she stood between Daybreaker and the terrified group of generals. “She had the strength to forgive me when even I could not.

But if you refuse, know that I will not allow you to stop ponykind from achieving their destined glory.

The dark alicorn landed roughly at the foot of the palace and rolled limply down the stairs. Daybreaker leapt through the broken window and landed just above Luna, the masonry cracking under her hooves.\n\n“I don’t know what I was expecting. You never cared for ponykind as I did! It is no wonder you won’t take the next step in securing their future. Very well. I will not have your weakness staining my empire.”\n\nLuna slowly got back to her hooves and turned to her corrupted sister. “A thousand years ago, you showed great strength in opposing me when I had lost myself. I never thought I would one day have to repay the favour. Whatever happens, know that I love you, Tia.”\n\nFor the briefest moment, Luna swore she could see thin wisps of steam escape her sister’s eyes.

Houses were burning, the sky was red and the grass was blackened and lifeless. Her hopes of winning were gone. Luna could feel her strength waning with each blow, yet Daybreaker’s attacks only seemed to get more vicious as the battle wore on. But if she could just hold on long enough for somepony to get reach Twilight and the other element bearers, it would all be worth it.\n\nHer moment of distraction cost her dearly when Daybreaker cast another blinding beam of crimson energy at her. The beam shattered her shield with a deafening bang and continued onwards, blasting Luna into the castle wall. The back of her head slammed into the hard stone, sending stars flashing across her vision. For a second, Luna considered just giving up. But something in the back of her mind pushed her onwards.\n\nSlowly, Luna got back on her hooves. Daybreaker chuckled as she glided out of the raging inferno to land just a few metres from the moon princess. There was a playful smile on her face. It broke Luna’s heart to see her sister’s radiant smile marred by those evil fangs.\n\n“Don’t fret, Luna. I’ll make sure the world remembers your name. For a thousand years they will tell the story of how the sun defeated the moon at the dawning of the Solar Empire!”\n\nLuna leapt forward, trying to catch Daybreaker by surprise while she was monologuing. But a crimson aura tightened around her neck, preventing her from moving. Daybreaker gave Luna a smug grin before slamming her back into the palace wall."

That trick had nearly depleted her magic reserves and Luna could already feel her beaten and bruised body giving up on her. And she only had a few seconds before Daybreaker traced her magic signature and resumed her relentless attack.\n\nLuna couldn’t help the tears that gathered in her eyes. It wasn’t supposed to end like this! Everything had been perfect. Celestia had forgiven her when Luna couldn’t even forgive herself. Harmony was spreading across the world. Ponykind was at peace. But that world was ash, just like the ground beneath Luna’s hooves.\n\nA foreign emotion wormed its way into her mind. Anger. Celestia had burnt that perfect world down! First with her ‘reforms’, then with her transformation into Daybreaker! She cast us out just for wanting recognition, only to become worse than we ever were!\n\nLuna paused. Those thoughts and feelings were not her own. So where had they come from? Before she could investigate, a pleasant voice soothed her fears. It was foreign and yet so hauntingly familiar. The voice spoke to her like an old friend. Her only friend. It promised her strength. The strength to end Daybreaker’s madness and right an ancient wrong. All Luna had to do was embrace it.\n\n“There you are!” Daybreaker shouted. In the blink of the eye she was standing before Luna, a manic glint in her gaze. “How foolish. The shadows cannot protect you from the sun!”\n\nAnother explosion sent Luna flying back. But she twisted her wings and landed on her hooves, glaring at Daybreaker with all the defiance she could muster. The voice was now screaming in her mind. Luna knew her name.

The flames in her mane dimmed enough for Luna to see traces of rainbow lingering at the edges.\n\n“Ponies are dead because of me, Luna,” Daybreaker turned away, but Luna could still see thin wisps of steam escape her sister's eyes. “That is unforgivable.”\n\n“But it’s not your fault. It’s the fault of creatures like Chrysalis, Sombra and Tirek. You have done nothing but care for ponykind. I know you would never harm them. So don’t blame yourself for all the cruel monsters out there.”\n\nLuna took a step forward, but Daybreaker shuffled backwards. There was a look of fearful disbelief in her eyes, as if she was unable to comprehend Luna’s words. Sensing her uncertainty, Luna extended her hoof, ignoring the shrieking voice of Nightmare Moon ordering her to attack her sister.\n\n“Please Celestia. I want to help you.”\n\nDaybreaker glanced between the offered hoof and Luna’s loving face. Then she snarled, the fire of her hair lashing out angrily. “I am the sun! I have the power to shred this planet to its atoms! My ponies are dead because I did nothing to save them! There can be no forgiveness for me until every wretched creature that has ever spilt pony blood is reduced to ash!”\n\nThe heat radiating from Daybreaker was unbearable, but Luna forced herself to take another step closer. “Your heart is in the right place, but if you walk this path you’ll only make ponykind’s enemies more numerous. You don’t have to do this. We can make the world safe and happy together.”\n\nLuna closed the last of the distance separating her from Daybreaker and pulled her into a hug. Even when the flames of Daybreaker’s mane melted the flesh of her forelegs, Luna refused to let go. “I love you, Celestia. It breaks my heart to see you in this much pain.”\n\nA powerful force slammed into Luna, sending her flying across the ashen gardens.

A dark aura gathered around her, devouring the light of the morning sky. Even Daybreaker’s radiance dimmed in the face of the all-consuming blackness.\n\nYes, this was the power Luna needed! Celestia had revealed her true self, proving all of Luna's doubts and suspicions correct. She has lied to the world. Lied to her sister! While Celestia was chastising Luna for simply wanting recognition, she had been secretly nurturing the flaming monument to her own arrogance that now stood before her. Now that fate had offered Celestia the opportunity to do away with these illusions of equality between night and day, she pretended to care about ponykind so Luna would let her guard down! All these thoughts rushed into Luna, fed to her by the being that knew Luna’s weaknesses and vulnerabilities better than Luna herself. The last of her resistance began to crumble.\n\n“Sister, please...” Luna’s voice faded away. The last thing she saw were the flaming eyes of Daybreaker, watching her with callous indifference. Then she was forced to the back of her consciousness as a new presence took control.\n\nNightmare Moon had returned.\n\n“Ah, it feels so good to be free,” The dark alicorn laughed. Her arrival had revitalised the night princess, healing her injuries and replenishing her depleted magic reserves.\n\n“And so the traitor shows her true colours,” Daybreaker mused. Her indifferent expression morphed into a wide grin. “Good.

Who did Celestia think she was, summoning him and then making him wait with these filthy commoners? He was a general! Granted, Idle Rich had never actually commanded anything larger than a house party. Another pony might have claimed that the long years of peace had devolved Equestria’s military into nothing but a social club for Canterlot’s wealthy. But Idle Rich wouldn’t complain. War was such a dirty business. There was much more profit to be made on the home front.\n\nThe doors swung open and a group of ponies stumbled out. Idle Rich quickly recognised them as the peasant rabble Celestia had promoted in favour of more deserving candidates suggested by the peerage. But something was different about them. They appeared pale and frightened, either angrily whispering with their neighbours or scurrying out of the palace. The nobles watched them leave with a disinterested glare.\n\nBut as soon as they had left, the temperature quickly soared. Ponies cried out in shock when a tornado of fire appeared on the throne. An alicorn stepped out of the flames. She towered over the crowd, standing tall and proud in red-hot armour with a mane of fire roaring behind her. Her coat was a pale white and glowed from inside with unnatural power. The air hummed with malice as she surveyed the crowd as one would a mouldy piece of bread.\n\n“Greetings, sycophants and traitors. I am sorry for making you wait, but I just had a very enlightening meeting with my high command to access their loyalty. I’m a busy mare, so I’ll just skip right to the part where I burn you alive.”\n\nIdle Rich felt his blood turn to ice. Before her words could truly sink in, the doors and windows were sealed with a crimson aura. The unicorns desperately tried to teleport away, but something was keeping them from using their magic.\n\n“You pathetic creatures. How dare you think that your titles give you power over the sun? Long have I struggled to do what’s best for my little ponies. And long have your kind been there to stand in my way,” Flames gathered around her horn as the monstrous alicorn smiled at them. “But that ends today. I am going to reforge Equestria into an empire of unparalleled might and prosperity. And I won’t allow you to stop me.”\n\nScreams of pain and terror echoed through the palace. Agent Sweetie Drops listened to their cries through a crack in the throne room door until she couldn’t stomach it any longer. With trembling hooves, Sweetie Drops reached for her radio."

Just as she tried to get back on her hooves a crimson aura pinned her to the cold stone. Daybreaker glided down to meet her, the howling blizzard causing steam to radiate from her coat.\n\n“Why didn’t you accept my offer?!” Daybreaker demanded. “Why, Luna? Do you truly hate the idea of me giving the enemies of ponykind the fiery death they deserve? You stand between me and the total annihilation of evil in this world!”\n\nBefore Luna could respond, Daybreaker teleported above her and stomped down on her injured wing. The night princess screamed in agony and struggled in vain against the magic holding her in a vice grip. As the initial pain faded, Luna forced air into her aching lungs and gave Daybreaker a sad look.\n\n“I don’t care how many monsters you kill. I only care about you. Please Celestia, you don’t have to do this! There are other ways. I know these past years have been hard on you and I’m sorry for not noticing. But friendship still has a place in the world. You just need to give it a chance.”\n\nDaybreaker sighed and stepped off Luna’s wing, allowing Luna to slowly heal the burnt flesh.\n\n“I gave friendship a chance and it failed me,” Daybreaker’s eyes had dimmed to mere embers. “It’s too late to change me back, Luna. I’m done with watching ponies die from the sidelines. You had your chance to do the same, but you chose weakness. I’m sorry it had to come to this, but I can’t let you stand in my way.”\n\nLuna only had mere seconds to summon a protective barrier before Daybreaker sent a beam of plasma towards her. As the shield began to collapse, Luna tensed her legs. She’d only get one chance.\n\nThe shield broke and Luna leapt into the air, experly twisting her body so that the explosion would carry her over the edge of the mountain. Her wings unfurled and Luna soared away from the ashen battlefield. Though her heart was filled with sorrow, Luna refused to shed another tear. Crying was for those who had already given up. "

The alicorn’s pure white coat was stained with her own burning blood, the result of the hundred minor cuts Luna had inflicted. For the first time, Luna could almost see fear in those burning eyes.\n\nAt Luna’s command, shadowy blades shot out of the darkness. Daybreaker sensed their presence and summoned a flaming shield to protect herself, causing the blades to shatter and dissipate. She growled and cast her gaze over Luna's hiding spot.\n\n“Enough games, Luna! Show yourself!” Daybreaker demanded, her words dripping with frustration and rage.\n\n“Please sister, end this madness,” Luna pleaded as she appeared in a flash of blue light before her corrupted sister. Daybreaker spun around to face her, charging her horn with another flame spell.\n\n“You just don’t get it, do you? This is not madness,” Daybreaker flashed Luna a viscious grin. “There is nothing mad about wanting to protect your children. The truth is, Luna, I’ve never felt more sane!”\n\n“I know. When I was Nightmare Moon, I thought I was doing the right thing. I was so consumed by rage and jealousy that nothing could have convinced me it was wrong to attack you. Just like nothing will convince you to renounce your destructive ambitions.”\n\n“Then why waste time with words?” Daybreaker spat. She slowly approached the moon princess, herding her towards the stone of the castle wall. “You took a great risk appearing before me. I could reduce you to atoms in a heartbeat.”\n\n“Because I know my kind and loving sister will never be beyond saving,” Luna stood still, not even flinching as Daybreaker bared her fanged teeth. “It may take decades to heal the pain in your heart, but I will show you the same forgiveness you showed me.”\n\nDaybreaker snarled and unleashed an explosion of plasma at her sister. But when the glow faded, the image of Luna was unaffected. It flickered once before winking out of existence. Before Daybreaker could realise she’d been tricked, the real Luna leapt out of the shadows and forced Daybreaker to the ground with shadowy chains.

Even in this form you pale in comparison to me.”\n\nNightmare Moon managed to teleport out of her sister’s path, but Daybreaker was waiting for her with another bolt of white-hot magic. She narrowly dodged the beam then spun around to send a jet of dark magic at her foe.\n\n“You know, a part of me was still unsure about killing you,” Daybreaker slowly approached her beaten sister, summoning a shield to block the weak attack. “So thank you for not pretending to be a kind and forgiving sister.

And do I get even a shred of recognition for my work? No. Ponykind was always too busy fawning over you.”\n\nDaybreaker cast her wrathful eyes to a shape in the gloom. It was darker than the surrounding shadows, as if something had devoured all the light in that spot. The shapeless mass glided forward, gradually taking the form of an alicorn. The day princess unleashed a beam of solar magic at the figure, only for her attack to be snuffed out by the shadows like a mere candle flame.\n\n“And even when you have everything, you still. want. more.”\n\nThe shadows leapt at Daybreaker, who barely managed to deflect their strike with a plasma shield. But others leapt out, slicing her hooves and tearing through her fiery mane. Again and again they struck, pressing in from all sides at the command of their mistress.\n\n“But I’m done playing your game. This will be your end, sister. The final triumph of night over day!”\n\nDaybreaker fought against the primal fear that gripped her heart and channeled magic to her horn. A beam of plasma pierced the shadows, allowing the sunlight to flood the tiny space.\n\nDaybreaker leapt into the opening, fear driving her wings forward even as the shadows tried to drag her back into the abyss. She gave one final push and shot into the Canterlot night sky, leaving the mass of shadows to wind itself around the Royal Palace. Haunting laughter resounded across the heavens, the sound echoing in the solar alicorn’s mind."

The handful of loyalist garrisons posted to the Stalliongrad border found themselves surrounded by Stalliongrad's armies and quickly surrendered. Empress Daybreaker has promised swift retribution for those responsible, but Gensec [STG.GetLeader] was quoted as saying that the morning's events were a natural consequence of Equestrian alicorncracy. With both nations competing for supremacy over Equus, conflict between Stalliongrad and the Solar Empire has become all but certain."

 paxsolaris.337.d:0 "Iron Valour tried to focus on the report in front of him, but he couldn’t help but glance at the newest addition to the command table. There were many words he could use to describe Aurora Shinespark. Few of them pleasant. He’d attended Celestia’s School for Gifted Unicorns with the mare. And while she was a brilliant student of magic, there was always something... off about her. Flattery that never felt sincere. Smiles that didn’t quite reach her eyes.\n\nAfter graduation, Iron Valour had all but forgotten about the odd mare. Until they met again in officers training. Once again, Aurora excelled even when their teachers had shown concerns about her eagerness to employ cruel tactics in their wargames. Perhaps if somebody had looked closer, they could have done something. But Aurora's pleasant smile and soft demeanor blinded them to her true nature. They only saw a young and talented officer, eager to serve. She passed officer training with flying colours and was sent to command the Severyan garrison.\n\nAnd then came the December Revolution. It was a short war. By the time Iron Valour had arrived, Celestia had already ordered a retreat. But the returning soldiers told stories of a mare who had ordered them to show no quarter to the traitors. Her mages had torched entire villages, leaving only ash and scorched bones in their wake. He shouldn’t have been surprised when Aurora Shinespark was identified as the one responsible. Celestia had swiftly court-martialed her, but her ties to the nobility kept her out of prison. And Iron Valour had hoped that was the last he would hear of her.\n\nBut here she was, once more commanding the armies of Equestria under Daybreaker’s orders. Iron Valour wished he had taken the opportunity to resign when Daybreaker had first offered it, but the implied threat had cowed him into compliance. Now here he was, surrounded by psychopaths and madmares, trying not to flinch every time Aurora glanced his way."

Each blow produced a deafening bang, each magical attack sent flames raining down upon the earth far beneath them. The very air trembled with power, whipped into a frenzy by the magic of the two goddesses.\n\nDaybreaker soared through the clouds like a comet, the flames dancing along her wings merging with her mane and tail. Her pony form could barely contain the power flowing through her veins. With a snarl of rage, the fire surrounding her exploded outward, clearing the sky of clouds and sending Nightmare Moon spiraling to the ground.\n\nShe recovered from her freefall and flew back up to meet her foe. Daybreaker laughed and sent a beam of crimson magic to intercept her, forcing Nightmare Moon to meet the beam with one of her own. The magic of the two sisters collided together in a brilliant ball of light and the world seemed to hold its breath. Daybreaker snarled and the ball inched its way forward. Slowly at first, then it picked up speed. Nightmare Moon closed her eyes just as her magic flickered out of existence. The plasma beam exploded against her torso, flinging her out of the sky at hypersonic speeds.\n\nShe landed with enough force to shake the earth. Nightmare Moon tried to stand back up, but the pain was too much. Her bones were shattered and her wings reduced to blackened stumps. Every breath she took was agonising. The last of her resolve faded and she collapsed to the ground.\n\nDaybreaker shot into the air and drew energy straight from the sun’s nuclear heart. Even as energy caused her skin to flake away and expose the maelstrom of power within, Daybreaker drew more into her body. She twisted her gaze back towards the defeated alicorn. To see the eyes that had haunted her nightmares for a thousand years filled with such raw terror pleased Daybreaker to no end. And yet, there was something else in that gaze. Regret. Loss. Grief. The world faded away and Daybreaker saw a tiny blue foal, gazing up at her with wide, loving eyes. She cradled the foal in her forelegs and gently rocked it, whispering a soft lullaby that brought back long forgotten memories of warm summers and childish adventure. Then the foal crumbled to ashes and was swept away by the tornado of fire raging around her, leaving Daybreaker alone with her corrupted sister."

The magical field heaved as the energy blasted through the sky, arcing down and exploding against the side of a mountain with a crack that could be heard across Equestria. Rocky debris rained from the sky, covering the ground around Luna with craters.\n\nThe earth trembled as Daybreaker landed. Luna managed to twist her head towards her sister, a look of disbelief written on her face. She looked like she wanted to say something, but couldn’t quite manage the words.\n\nDaybreaker gave Luna a piercing glare. “That was a warning. If you ever show your face in my nation again, I won’t miss.”\n\n“Why? Why spare me?”\n\n“Does it matter? You’re alive. Now go, before I change my mind. This is my nation and my people to lead. You have no place here.”\n\nLuna forced herself to her hooves. “Celestia...I-”\n\n“LEAVE!” Daybreaker screamed as she gripped Luna with her magic and threw the alicorn into the air. At first she tumbled like a ragdoll, but she managed to open her burnt wings just before she hit the ground. She gave Daybreaker one last sorrowful glance before gliding away. Daybreaker stood riveted to the spot as she watched Luna grow smaller against the cloudy sky."

Crimson eyes met cyan and Daybreaker’s resolve crumbled. She tried to reach out, but it was too late. Nightmare Moon sent Daybreaker one last hateful glare before she closed her eyes for the last time. Daybreaker was flung away by an explosion of nuclear fury. She turned and glided through the shockwave, landing in the half molten crater left by her attack.\n\nNot for the first time did Daybreaker curse her existence. She thought back on those ancient childhood memories. Before Nightmare Moon. Before Daybreaker. Before millennia of time and hardship had eroded their relationship. When it was just Celestia and Luna. Were they destined to come to blows, even back then?\n\nA misshapen lump caught her attention. Daybreaker beat her wings once to clear the haze of ash and radioactive dust. And for the first time in a thousand years, the solar princess felt cold. A skull was lying half buried in the sand. It was bleached white, with a horn far longer than any unicorn could have. Daybreaker cradled it in her shaking hooves and felt tears stream down her cheeks.\n\n“Why, Luna?” Daybreaker clutched the skull tightly. “I never meant to make you feel like you didn’t belong. Why did you make me do this?”\n\nBut she would get no answer. Nightmare Moon was gone and she’d taken Luna with her. Tiny blue lights began to drift off the bleached bones.

Still, I had to at least pay some attention, if they were going to be successful.\n\nThe station itself was bustling with activity, though I, Sunrise Sparkle, ignored all of that. Instead, I looked for my quarry- an Crystal Guard. Mindful of the shocked and confused stares, and the guard's nervous gaze. He no doubt had spotted a few things. Firstly that I was Twilight Sparkle. Or was, rather, but he didn't need to know that. Secondly that I was in the company of a batpony and a couple other well-ragged ponies, clearly refugees. Thirdly, the well-battered and practically ancient .32 calibre revolver jammed in an equally ancient holster on my right hip.\n\nDeterminedly, I ignored the gazes and his wariness, and trotted up to the guard, using my magic to remove and levitate the pistol and belt away from my barrel- and careful not to knock loose my Kolibri hidden away within the rags.

That bit, at least, was true. Re-education would take a few moons, after all. I paused, taking a sip of my tea. "Luna has been... deposed of, to put things mildly."\n\nTo put them more firmly: she was gone. Permanently, this time.\n\nWhilst Cadence was stirring her own tea, trying to gather her thoughts, I chanced a gaze up to the wall clock- it'd been a couple hours. Hopefully, Scorecard hadn't run into any troubles."

 solarempiresparkles.6.d:0 "I heard the pounding on my door as I roused myself from my sleep and immediately realised what'd happened. That idiot bat pony had gotten himself caught and that meant I was burnt. Thinking quickly, I took my Kolibri pistol, and gazing about myself, grit my teeth as I lit up my horn. Risky, but necessary, I swallowed the minuscule weapon, feeling somewhat sickly as I choked it down my throat. Then, I cast a long ago learnt medical spell to stave off the effects of the onset lead poisoning for a full forty-eight hours. Long enough for me to exhume the weapon- preferably by mouth- later. I then put on my sleepiest face, and stumbled over to the door, opening it.\n\nAs I suspected, I was slammed quickly to the ground and placed in hoofcuffs, a horn bracket clamped at my horn's base to prevent magic.\n\n"Twilight Sparkle, you are under arrest for conspiracy of treason against the Crystal throne. If you resist, you shall be terminated with extreme prejudice."\n\n"Well sod you too, whatever your name is. Bloody wonderful thing to wake up to."\n\nA few hours of processing later, and I was in the dungeons, far below the castle itself. Ironic, in my opinion. Cadence and Shining had, of course, come down and given me the usual spiels, and I'd played the unrepentant zealot- which, to be fair, I probably am- and so I was left to my own devices. Waiting a few minutes to make sure I was fully alone, I moved to a dark corner of the room. I didn't have magic, but I still had a Kolibri, after all. It was all just about finding the proper time to break out, now."
 solarempiresparkles.6.a:0 "It was worth a try..."

 solarempiresparkles.15.t:0 "Execute"
 solarempiresparkles.15.d_susp:0 "There was a slight knock on the door, as Scorecard let himself in, closing and locking it behind him. He looked frustrated, as I gazed questioningly at the batpony from over my reading glasses. "Well?"\n\n"I was caught." He whispered softly, holding up a hoof to placate me. "I explained it away at being lost, but they're no doubt more suspicious. Nonetheless I did manage to get what I was looking for, so we have that going for us."\n\nI'd have said I expected better, but truthfully, I'd expected worse out of the barely a pony. "Very well. We'll go forward, cautiously. Give me a few hours to prepare; I'll find you." With a soundless nod, he turned about and left, locking the door back behind him. Just in case."
 solarempiresparkles.15.d:0 "I looked up from the book I'd been reading, as somepony knocked gently on the door. "It's open." I greeted neutrally, unsure of who was at the door. As the familiar face of Scorecard entered the room, shutting it behind him with a smile, I shut the book, and gave the stallion my full attention. "Well?"\n\n"Everything is ready. Should be smooth sailing from here on out, Sparkle." He stated softly as he walked over, careful not to give anything that he did not have to away, in case we were being spied upon.\n\n"Good to hear. I'll come find you when I'm ready, then. Good evening, Scorecard."\n\n"And you as well, Sparkle." And with a nod, he was gone, as I settled back into my reading. I'd give it a few hours, then go forward with the operation. Tonight was to be a night of swiftness and precision, and I needed time to prepare myself, mentally. Soon."

 solarempiresparkles.150.t:0 "Almost there"
 solarempiresparkles.150.d:0 "Scorecard placed a hoof against the wall of the hallway we were in. Tapping soundlessly against it to a rhythm he only knew- the rhythm of a guard's hoofsteps. A long, tense, second, then he gave me a fanged grin and nodded. I couldn't help but smirk back. Pathetic excuse for a pony he may have been, but he was damn good at his work. I'd have to request Daybreaker for further use of his services, once this was all over.\n\nThe four of us slunk into the next hall, and halted outside a particular room I'd known quite well. Princess Flurry Heart's bedroom. Hopefully, the filly would be sleeping quietly, and not raise quite a ruckus. I softly pushed the door open, and, as my eyes adjusted to the darkness, my breath died in my throat.\n\nFlash Sentry, a massive handcannon of some sort in on his hip, exhaled gently, moving his hoof away from the holster. "Jeez, Pr-Twilight. Scared me half to death."\n\nThis moronic idiot was guarding my Niece? Now I was doubly glad I was stealing her away. "Ah, apologies...Corporal?"\n\n"Er. Major, actually. Got a battlefield commission!"\n\n"Major? You are moving up in the world, Flash." I started to doubt the sanity of my brother - putting Flash Sentry in any position of responsibility?\n\n"Mind if I step in for a minute? I wanted to see Flurry Heart again..."\n\n"Oh, of course, your hi- ma'am. No reason you can't. You are her aunt after all. Just keep it down, she is sleeping."\n\nI flicked my gaze momentarily back to Scorecard, who nodded and fell back from the door, to explain to the twins, as I myself stepped inside, closing the door gently behind me. Almost mechanically, I lit a small light spell with my horn, cantering gently over. "It's been so long since I've seen her, it feels.""

"Twilight Sparkle's magic is magenta." He stated simply.\n\nI clicked my tongue, and turned about, slowly, so as not to provoke the stallion, maintaining my magical aura to avoid his suspicion. I didn't want to resort to my Kolibri- yet.\n\nInstead I used my magic to wrest the gun from his grip, as it discharged harmlessly into the ceiling. Flash closed the distance, slamming me into the ground, as the door to the room itself burst open. Jabbing a wing at my chest to expunge the breath from my lungs, his other tugged at a shrill- whistle, quickly brought to his mouth, as it sung out an alarm. A quick whip from Scorecard's Welrod, directly to Flash's head, knocked the stallion out, but the damage had already been done."

The twins spun about, their own weapons- knives- at the ready, and were similarly cut down by what could only be the Crystal Guard. I quickly tossed my Kolibri out the open window above Flurry's bed, before letting my magic fall silent, holding my hooves up in surrender as Crystal Guards filled the room.\n\n"Twilight Sparkle of [This.GetNameDef], you are under arrest for plotting and attempted treason against the Crystal Crown, Espionage between two sovereign nations, and assuming Major Sentry does not survive, Murder. Do not resist."\n\nLike I had much of a choice."
 solarempiresparkles.18.b:0 "I was so close..."

 solarempiresparkles.18.t:0 "Slip away"
 solarempiresparkles.18.d:0 "Thinking quickly, I stood to my hooves, and motioned for the other three to come close. Wasting no time, I let out a flash teleport, as the room burst open, my breath momentarily catching in my throat as I came face to face with a very angry Shining Armor.\n\nWe found ourselves out in the snow, as I allowed my fury to swell, lending heat to myself and the others. I wished for nothing more than to bring the holy ruination of my Empress' ruination down upon the Crystal Ponies. However, I had to remain calm and collected. The Crystal Guard would no doubt be looking for us, as Cadence's insistence, so time was of the essence. Quickly, I formed a spell Matrix, centred on Canterlot, and lit up my horn. At least we would escape to tell the tale."

 solarempiresparkles.16.t:0 "Success"
 solarempiresparkles.16.d:0 ""I mean, you were here just a few weeks ago, remember?" Flash then paused, as if he'd started to say something, then thought of something else.\n\n"Twilight, why is your magical aura yellow?"\n\nMy heart skipped a beat, and my brain froze, as I turned to face the stallion, who was more confused than concerned. I no doubt had a troubled smile on my face.\n\n"Oh, well, you see-" a quick flick of my horn, and the minuscule Kolibri- smallest developed pistol in the world, apparently, chirped four times, it's normally incredibly inaccurate 2.7mm rounds travelling the short journey from the barrel to Sentry's barrel, as he flopped back, down and out for the count. Scorecard and the twins burst in immediately, carrying their own holdout weapons, consisting of a stiletto, another Kolibri, and a Solar Imperial made Welrod. I chanced a look over to Flurry; still sleeping soundly, and levitated her over in my magic, dropping the Kolibri- it's job was over. After awaiting a tense moment to make sure I wasn't interrupted, the four of us bunched up, my magic bringing Flurry close to my barrel, and I began to cast my oft-used spell.\n\nA few matrices and we were safely home across the border, Hollow Shades' quiet farmhouses greeting us.

For the past two days, we'd gone nowhere, arguing back and forth and back and forth about the Empire's eventual accession back into [This.GetNameDef]. And, by extension, Cadence's flat refusal to do so.\n\nFlapping my wings in frustration, I made my way to the Royal Garden- a poor mockery of the Canterlot Garden, though that was to be expected from a poor mockery of a proper Empire. Still, I could use the change in pace to gather my thoughts.

"Hey, you two."\n\n"Hey, Twily!" Came Shining's reply, as Flurry beamed- she'd always enjoyed seeing me.\n\nThe growing mare then bounded over to me, much like she had when she was a young filly- still not used to her larger than average wingspan, it seemed. "Hi auntie! Howzit in Equestria?"\n\nEquestria? Had.. had Cadence been keeping the two in the dark? Shining made no moves to correct her...\n\n"Oh, busy, you know how it is."\n\n"I can imagine," Shining nodded, before continuing. "What with you being D-Princess Celestia's new Science minister and all that. What brings you here?"\n\nThey had. They had really been keeping my little Flurry-burry in the dark. "Oh, you know. Bureaucracy. I'm overseeing the opening of a new academy here, perhaps Cadence mentioned it?"\n\n"Oh, yes, the Crystal Academy, right? It's about time that opened."\n\n"Quite so." A thought crossed my mind. "In fact, why don't the three of us go tour it before all the students swamp in, eh?"\n\n"Why, that sounds like a splendid idea! Flurry, why don't you go put away your fencing equipment, and we'll make a family outing out of it."\n\n"That sounds excellent. Here, Flurry, I can teleport us to your room, that should make it quick."\n\n"Sure, Auntie!" With her approval, I did so, as we arrived inside her palatial room. She went to put away her gear, and I went about drawing a spell matrix. She returned, somewhat confused as I hit her with a strong sleep spell, before she was able to say anything. I exhaled. That was easier than I'd hoped. Turning to the door, I locked it, and levitated Flurry's somewhat weighty body over to my own. She'd forgive me eventually. The task done, I planted myself within the spell matrix, and lit up my horn. Next stop? [SOL.Capital.GetName]."

 solarempiresparkles.34.d:0 "I stepped proudly off the Solar Imperial express train, flanked by veteran inquisitors to my left and right. I myself stood squarely in the centre of the formation, the robes and finery of my station as Grand Solar Inquisitor catching in the winter breeze, as I swept my gaze across the gathered guards. I smiled, widely, a territorial and unfriendly smile. "Greetings, my good mares and stallions. We've an appointment with Her Highness, Mi Amore Cadenza. You will take us to her, post-haste."\n\nWithin minutes, we were being lead through the doors of the castle itself, a cadre of Crystal Guards surrounding us, carrying very real and very loaded rifles, at parade rest. Not even worth the effort to dispatch them, really, if it came to blows. It'd take... perhaps fifteen seconds; eight if I actually cared enough to focus on them.\n\nCadenza seemed shocked, as I made my way towards her throne, until I was ordered to stop by the guards. \n\n"I come bearing a message from Our Empress, Daybreaker: She Who Raises The Sun, Sol Invicta, the Dawn Hammer, True Goddess of this mortal world, may she reign eternally." I bowed, formally, as I presented my ruler's titles to Cadenza. After the requisite time passed, I returned to my standing position, and my Solar-touched gaze met that of Mi Amore Cadenza's - for the first time since I'd arrived, as I relished in her fear and uncertainty. "Her message is as follows: you shall return you and your ponies to our Solar Fold," I paused, to ensure I had her full attention, and that she fully understood my ultimatum."

Unholy fires blazed behind her eyes, as she proclaimed her Empress' rule, and I bit my tongue momentarily as she awaited my response. Steeling myself, I obliged the Solar Witch."

I echoed, giving her a chance to renege on her poor wording.\n\n"No," she doubled down, "We shall stand firm against any and all tyranny, including that of your ruler. Be gone, harlot, and do not return."\n\nI wanted nothing more than to smite the insolent whelp where she stood. It would be a boringly easy task. A simple flick of the horn, and she would be naught but ash upon holy fire burnt ground.\n\nBut, Daybreaker's orders had been clear. My mane smouldered, as the odour of Sulphur bloomed in the air, and I grit my teeth. "Very well, you miserable excuse for an alicorn. Your chance was given. Now the blood of your peoples falls upon your hooves." And with my words spoken, I turned upon my hooves, surrounded by my loyal inquisitors and the Crystal Guard, and headed back towards the train. War would come, and war would come soon. And then Cadence would know the true ruination of Daybreaker's Holy Sun."

It appears that while many ponies have seen the light and the reason within the Empress, some others have decided to cling onto their old ways of 'Harmony', and they now seek to bring down our new Order from within. Needless to say, this is quite the problem indeed, and we would best be of to crush this movement before it can get any more popularity among the populace."

We might even discover more batponies akin to Comet Trail, who proved to be loyal to the cause before. As such we should welcome those batponies who wish to follow us with a loving embrace of mother, afterall they too are our little ponies. We will integrate batponies into our society, under guiding hoof of the imperial inquisition. Our dear student should be up to the task, we are sure she will be able to come up with "oh-so-detailed" plans for integration of batponies. Perhaps if we let them join military. Their talents would be of great benefit to us and we might even discover new skilled officers among them.

 solarempire.41.d:0 "It is hard to keep track of all the thestral tribes scattered around the Empire. Our land is vast and it is not effective to look for each individual tribe in far reaches of jungles or some misbegotten mountains. We should organize resettlement of thestrals and move them somewhere where we can easily keep track of them. Isles near our coast seem like a good pick for such a task. Some of them are large enough to sustain sizable thestral population. We should "encourage" resettlement and help them build new cities. We are in no way giving up on our citizens, it will simply be much easier to watch over them. We will have our inquisitors work in these new cities and educate thestrals. These new cities might even develop into new industrial centers in time. Naturally, at first there might be some dissent against this idea but eventually they will come to see it is for the best.

There is only one possible solution to this situation. We must purify them by only mean possible - in the holy flames. Our imperial inquisition will be more than capable to achieve this. They will round up all the thestrals and do what must be done. It may not seem right at the moment, but they will inevitably pose a threat to stability of our Empire in future. We will not stop until every single bat has been hunted down and defeated. We must steal away our hearts and do what must be done for preservation of stability within our Empire. Stability of the Empire must be preserved at all cost and if few batpony lives are the cost of it, then it is a price we are willing to pay.
